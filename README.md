This homework assignment analyzes a dataset discussed in the FiveThirtyEight article titled “Why Many Americans Don’t Vote”. The dataset is based on survey results collected from over 8,000 participants, and is focused on identifying patterns surrounding individuals’ willingness or unwillingness to vote in US elections.

The original dataset includes questions about race, gender, income, age, party association, weight, and of course the target variable “voter_category”. Individuals are bucketed into three voter_categories: “Never Vote”, “Sometimes Vote”, “Always Vote”.

Voter apathy is a crux to any functioning democracy, so analysis of this sort is critical to understanding why individuals may choose to not participate, as well as identifying means to increase voter engagement for those “Not Voters” today.
