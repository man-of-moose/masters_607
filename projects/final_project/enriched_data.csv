Jon Rahm won his first major, the US Open, in June

World number one Jon Rahm has withdrawn from the DP World Tour Championship in order to spend time with his family.

It rules the Spaniard out of the running to win the Race to Dubai, in which he currently sits third behind Collin Morikawa and Billy Horschel.

Rahm has had a rollercoaster year, twice testing positive for Covid-19 and winning the US Open - his first major.

""I have come to the difficult decision not to travel to Dubai next week,"" he said.

""The demands of a long season with many ups and downs has taken a lot out of me. I feel I need to take time to recharge my batteries while spending quality time with my family.

""I would like to take this opportunity to wish DP World and the European Tour all the best for the season-ending event, which is always such a special tournament.""

Rahm won the Race to Dubai title, which crowns the European Tour's number one player, in 2019.

The 27-year-old won the US Open, in June, 15 days after being forced out of the Memorial Tournament because of his first positive Covid test, despite leading by six shots.

His second ruled him out of the Tokyo Olympics just a week before he was due to fly out to Japan, but he bounced back on a personal note, wining three and a half points from five matches in Europe's Ryder Cup defeat by the United States."

Tyson Fury knocked Deontay Wilder down three times on his way to victory in their trilogy fight in October

World heavyweight champion Tyson Fury has had surgery on both elbows after suffering a serious injury before his second win over Deontay Wilder, said the Briton's father John Fury.

Tyson, 33, gained a thrilling 11th-round win over the American to retain his WBC title in October in Las Vegas.

""Tyson was very badly injured going into that fight,"" John Fury told BT Sport.

""He was handicapped from the beginning. It wasn't a boxing match was it?""

Tyson was twice knocked down in the fourth round before knocking out Wilder in a brutal contest to remain undefeated and world champion.

""My son's number one, a legend and will be spoken about for hundreds of years,"" added his father. ""He's that damn good and got that burning desire to never get beaten.

""He had to have chromosome injections into both elbows. He's since had an operation, six hours, all day in hospital having them sorted out. He had some bone spurs he had to get removed.

""He said to me afterwards 'I couldn't box, I couldn't work the jab. If I'd missed the jab it would've put me in limp mode and I wouldn't have been able to fight.

""'The pain when throwing the jab was unbearable so I was fighting two people - the pain in my own body and him. All we could do was make it a war and I wanted to win more than he did'.""

Tyson Fury drew with Deontay Wilder in their first fight in December 2018, won in the seventh round of their rematch in February 2020 and in the 11th round of their third fight in October

'Tyson will be fighting when he's 40'

Fury has won 31 and drawn one of his 32 fights - with the draw coming in his first bout with Wilder before the Briton won the second and third - and his father believes he should not fight again.

""I said retire,"" added John Fury. ""He's won everything, nothing to prove and has millions of pounds in the bank, he's secure for life, there's more to life than getting your brains rattled.

""But he's his own man, he'll do what he's going to do but for me I said to call it [over].

""He's beaten the best man of his era three times, what more can he do?

""Tyson will spend two months at home and want the smell of sweat and leather. He'll be fighting when he is 40, he can't help himself, he's a human pitbull terrier.""

'He could beat Whyte and Usyk on the same night'

Ukrainian Oleksandr Usyk beat Britain's Anthony Joshua in September to win the WBA, IBF, WBO and IBO belts, while another British fighter, Dillian Whyte, is the mandatory challenger to Fury's WBC strap.

But John Fury believes none of them could beat his son and added: ""There'll always be someone like Usyk and then after him there'll be someone else. Usyk will do nothing with a man like Tyson.

""Joshua is a beaten thing, Dillian Whyte can fight, but is not the class of my son, no-one is. Tyson's a country mile above everyone else and he was not fit.

""He had Covid [in July], had two useless elbows, couldn't throw the jab, couldn't box properly and they still couldn't do anything with a half-fit man.

""Imagine Tyson firing on all cylinders. He could beat Whyte and Usyk on the same night with a proper camp behind him.""

Oleksandr Usyk (left) gained a unanimous points win over Anthony Joshua at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium in September

Joshua's loss ended hopes of an all-British unification bout to decide the first undisputed heavyweight champion since Lennox Lewis in 2000.

Tyson has offered to train Joshua before his rematch with Usyk, scheduled for spring 2022.

""Tyson could make Joshua a different fighter,"" said John Fury.

""Joshua can punch, he's got the right physique, everything to be a great. All he needs is to get the knowledge of what's missing and learn how to go into trench warfare.

""It's mental [for Joshua] one million percent. If things don't go well they plummet and he can't get back on track.

""AJ, with the right people around him, can come back and win [against Usyk] because he's a big lad, got a good array of boxing skills, all he needs is that dog in his belly and know how to fight.""

'Tommy should beat Jake Paul'

Light-heavyweight Tommy Fury has been a professional boxer since 2018, winning all seven of his fights

Tyson's half-brother Tommy will be taking on YouTuber-turned boxer Jake Paul in Florida on 18 December.

""He should beat Jake Paul at a canter and if he can't there's no way in boxing for him,"" said his father.

""It's a make-or-break fight for both but it would hit Tommy harder as he's a professional boxer.

""Has Tommy got the skill to beat him? Yes. Has he got the power to knock him out? Yes. But how can Tommy handle the occasion?

""Tyson will be in his corner and whatever desire Tommy is missing, Tyson will put it there.

""The only thing that can beat Tommy is Tommy. I'm looking for a Tommy win, an explosive finish, then we will move to the other brother Logan [Paul]."""

""Humanity as a whole is about 5-1 down at half-time,"" Prime Minister Boris Johnson said at the start of the COP26 climate summit.

""We've got a long way to go, but we can do it. We have the ability to come back but it's going to take a huge amount of effort. Team World is up against a very formidable opponent in climate change.""

As with the fight to overcome Covid, setting out the battle against climate change in sporting terms has become a popular analogy.

But Sport's role at COP over the past fortnight has been about more than just providing soundbites. It has had a more prominent place at this year's climate conference than ever before.

At the heart of the summit you had Olympic Gold medallist Hannah Mills, former Formula 1 world champion Nico Rosberg and ex-England international Ledley King together on stage raising awareness and being vocal.

With hotel rooms scarce and costly in Glasgow, Team GB rower and Champions for Earth campaigner Melissa Wilson was staying with her grandma, with Mills a house guest. They were there to promote their Dear Leaders of The World video, with messages from Andy Murray and Tom Daley, among others.

Former Formula 1 world champion Nico Rosberg was at the summit in Glasgow

Former Australia rugby union international David Pocock was another high-profile athlete to attend, meeting with ministers from his country of birth, Zimbabwe, to discuss regeneration projects and he was also speaking up on fossil fuel sponsorship of sport.

BBC Sport, Sky Sports and ITV Sport joined a panel talking of collaboration and the common aims and challenges in the broadcast sport sector. The talk was of how to normalise the conversation, raise awareness and hold an industry to account, together.

Front and centre in the main conference halls was electric motorsport. Formula E's Envision Virgin Racing team partnered with COP26 and their cars were on display, liveried with climate messaging like ""together for our planet"". There featured a two-seater prototype with the latest battery technology, contributing to the advance of electric vehicles on our streets.

Fans were getting involved too. Planet Super League were on a ferry on the Clyde presenting CUP26 to Cambridge United for their young fans' engagement in doing simple climate tasks to score points in a knockout competition against other teams.

Scotland's ""most sustainable football club"", Hibernian, took to the stage on Monday at a fringe event organised by Football for Future, a fan-led organisation working to build a more environmentally-sustainable culture in football.

Hibs' finance director Chris Gaunt was joined on stage by Stenhousemuir chairman Iain McMenemy, who expressed his disappointment at the lack of leadership from the top of the game and pledged to take that message to the next meeting of the Scottish Football Association, to cheers from the crowd.

Glamorgan cricketer Joe Cooke was in attendance to help draw attention to a manifesto for sport, signed by more than 300 athletes and organised by an American organisation called Eco Athletes. The aims of the document are around net zero goals, protection of habitats, carbon pricing and upholding the Paris Climate agreement.

Scotland is the home of golf and specifically links golf, with many courses literally slipping into the sea. ""Driving for change"" was an event featuring the R&A, the retired Norwegian golfer Suzann Pettersen and Sustainable Golf.

If COP26 had an Avengers Assemble moment it was Sunday afternoon in Toryglen, in the shadow of Hampden Park. In World COP26 many grassroots sports organisations played for a tiny upcycled trophy made of an old cricket ball, broken crockery and some sticks. Team names included Blah Blah Blah - they took to the pitch to the theme tune from the Champions League - and goal celebrations included all players falling down like skittles in a representation of ecological collapse.

Ways climate is already impacting sport

At the end of the world leaders segment in the first week of the conference, the prime minister continued his sporting theme, providing a score update. Talking about deals to limit deforestation and methane production at the summit he said: ""We've pulled back a goal, or perhaps even two, and I think we are going to be able to take this thing to extra time, because there's no doubt that some progress has been made.""

Sport's very own ""goal back"" arguably came the day after. The UN announced 46 signatories to a new tier of its Sport for Climate Action Framework. Aligned with the Race to Zero campaign, it requires those signed up to cut carbon emissions in half by 2030, be net zero by 2040 and report annually and publicly on progress towards these goals.

Many heralded the new targets and there is no doubt the existence of a transparent process is a big leap forward but the new scheme came with no new funding and no new personnel.

Progress with climate change often comes with a reminder of how far we still have to go and although 46 organisations signed up, that means 251 signatories to the original framework have not.

When you consider the fact the framework is open to all levels of sport and there are thousands of sports clubs, teams and organisations at amateur and elite levels, you see how far there is still to go in an industry that has a reported footprint the size of a country like Spain."

Owen Farrell and Manu Tuilagi were England's 10 and 12 during the 2019 World Cup quarter-final win against Australia

Autumn Nations Series: England v Tonga Venue: Twickenham, London Date: Saturday, 6 November Kick-off: 15:15 GMT Coverage: Live text commentary on the BBC Sport website and app.

Centre Manu Tuilagi will make his first England appearance since March 2020 against Tonga on Saturday, with captain Owen Farrell starting at fly-half.

Harlequins number 10 Marcus Smith, who lacked training time because of a leg injury this week, is on the bench.

Head coach Eddie Jones said naming Smith among the replacements was ""the most sensible thing"".

England's team announcement was delayed because a member of their support staff had tested positive for Covid-19.

No-one else tested positive in a further round of lateral flow testing, with PCR test results due on Friday morning.

Jones had wanted to see Smith and Farrell play together at 10 and 12, but the England captain will instead partner Sale's Tuilagi, with Henry Slade at outside centre.

""When [Smith] couldn't do our two main training runs on Tuesday or Thursday - but we're confident he's going to be 100% fit on Saturday - then the most sensible thing was to get him to do a little bit of training on Friday and be ready to come off the bench,"" Jones said.

""That will be best for him and best for the team. We want to see a Marcus Smith that builds the game, that shows the responsibility he has to the team.""

Marcus Smith made his England debut against the United States in July

Mitchell set for England debut

Elsewhere in England's injury-hit backline, Northampton scrum-half Alex Mitchell is set to make his debut from the bench, with Sale's Raffi Quirke and Bristol's Harry Randall both unable to play.

Freddie Steward wins his third cap at full-back, while Adam Radwan makes his second appearance on the right wing.

Props Ellis Genge and Kyle Sinckler start in the front row alongside hooker Jamie George. Jones said the presence of Tonga props Siegfried Fisi'ihoi and Ben Tameifuna meant England ""are going to have to go in the front door before the back door"".

Maro Itoje and Jonny Hill are in the second row, while Tom Curry starts at number eight, Courtney Lawes and Sam Underhill are the flankers and Alex Dombrandt is among the replacements.

Curry, Lawes and Genge have all been named vice-captains for the side's Autumn Nation Series opener at Twickenham.

""We respect Tonga greatly,"" Jones said of Saturday's opponents, with games against Australia and world champions South Africa to follow.

""We're especially looking forward to getting back out in front of a full crowd at Twickenham and playing some entertaining, exciting rugby for all of the supporters - we can't wait to have them back.""

For the visitors, Lopeti Timani, who won 12 caps for Australia, makes his Tonga debut at blind-side flanker after qualifying because he had represented the country in sevens.

Tuilagi returns in familiar midfield

Jones had shaken up his squad for the autumn internationals with the 2023 World Cup in mind after England's disappointing fifth place in the 2021 Six Nations.

But Smith's lack of training due to injury means a familiar midfield of Farrell, Tuilagi and Slade will take to the field against Tonga.

England have enjoyed plenty of success when Tuilagi has been fit, including a run to the 2019 World Cup final, but the 30-year-old has suffered from repeated injuries throughout his career.

Tuilagi was called into the England camp over the summer, but had to withdraw two days later because of a hamstring issue.

He returned in May after an eight month lay-off because of a torn Achilles but has previously spent long periods on the sidelines because of a torn pectoral muscle, repeated groin injuries and knee ligament damage.

Jones described Tuilagi as ""a real warrior"", adding: ""People love playing with him.

""He's an infectious personality. He's a tough, hard player. He's always in the team room either playing chess with Jonny May - they're the two world champions and you'll have a crowd around them - or he's out the golf course taking on Genge and Will Stuart in a long driving competition.

""He's one of those really good people to have in the team apart from being an exceptional gainline player.""

Leroy Sane scored twice for Germany in their 9-0 win over Liechtenstein

Hansi Flick made history as the first Germany coach to win his first six games in charge, with his Covid-affected side thrashing 10-man Liechtenstein in a World Cup qualifier.

Flick had to make numerous changes, with five players out because of defender Niklas Sule's Covid infection.

Thomas Muller and Leroy Sane both scored twice for the hosts, who have already qualified for Qatar 2022.

Liechtenstein were reduced to 10 men inside the first 10 minutes.

Jens Hofer was sent off for kicking Leon Goretzka with a high challenge in the face, and after a short delay, Manchester City's Ilkay Gundogan converted the resulting penalty.

It got worse for the visitors, who conceded three goals in three minutes, starting with Daniel Kaufmann turning in an own goal in the 20th.

Sane then slotted in before Marco Reus added another.

With Flick's predecessor Joachim Low, who received an official farewell before the game, watching from the stands, Germany struck again four minutes after the restart with Sane before late goals from Muller and Ridle Baku.

Muller then scored his second in the 86th before another own goal by Liechtenstein, this time from Max Goppel."

LONDON (AP) — Britain granted conditional authorization on Thursday to the first pill shown to successfully treat COVID-19 so far. It also is the first country to OK the treatment from drugmaker Merck, although it wasn’t immediately clear how quickly the pill would be available.

The pill was licensed for adults 18 and older who have tested positive for COVID-19 and have at least one risk factor for developing severe disease, such as obesity or heart disease. Patients with mild-to-moderate COVID-19 would take four pills of the drug, known molnupiravir, twice a day for five days.

An antiviral pill that reduces symptoms and speeds recovery could prove groundbreaking, easing caseloads on hospitals and helping to curb outbreaks in poorer countries with fragile health systems. It would also bolster the two-pronged approach to the pandemic: treatment, by way of medication, and prevention, primarily through vaccinations.

Molnupiravir is also pending review with regulators in the U.S., the European Union and elsewhere. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration announced last month it would convene a panel of independent experts to scrutinize the pill’s safety and effectiveness in late November.

Initial supplies will be limited. Merck has said it can produce 10 million treatment courses through the end of the year, but much of that supply has already been purchased by governments worldwide.

In October, U.K. officials announced they secured 480,000 courses of molnupiravir and expected thousands of vulnerable Britons to have access to the treatment this winter via a national study.

“Today is a historic day for our country, as the U.K. is now the first country in the world to approve an antiviral that can be taken at home for COVID-19,” British health secretary Sajid Javid said.

“We are working at pace across the government and with the NHS to set out plans to deploy molnupiravir to patients through a national study as soon as possible,” he said in a statement, referring to the U.K.’s National Health Service. Doctors said the treatment would be particularly significant for people who don’t respond well to vaccination.

Merck and partner Ridgeback Biotherapeutic have requested clearance for the drug with regulators around the world for adults with early cases of COVID-19 who are at risk for severe disease or hospitalization. That’s roughly the same group targeted for treatment with infused COVID-19 antibody drugs, the standard of care in many countries for patients who don’t yet require hospitalization.

Merck announced preliminary results in September showing its drug cut hospitalizations and deaths by half among patients with early COVID-19 symptoms. The results haven’t yet been peer reviewed or published in a scientific journal.

The company also didn’t disclose details on molnupiravir’s side effects, except to say that rates of those problems were similar between people who got the drug and those who received dummy pills.

The drug targets an enzyme the coronavirus uses to reproduce itself, inserting errors into its genetic code that slow its ability to spread and take over human cells. That genetic activity has led some independent experts to question whether the drug could potentially cause mutations leading to birth defects or tumors.

Britain’s Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency said molnupiravir’s ability to interact with DNA and cause mutations had been studied “extensively” and that it wasn’t found to pose a risk to humans.

“Studies in rats showed that (molnupiravir) may cause harmful effects to the unborn offspring, although this was at doses which were higher than those that will be given to humans, and these effects were not observed in other animals,” the agency said in an email.

In company trials, both men and women were instructed to either use contraception or abstain from sex. Pregnant women were excluded from the study. Merck has stated that the drug is safe when used as directed.

Molnupiravir was initially studied as a potential flu therapy with funding from the U.S. government. Last year, researchers at Emory University decided to repurpose the drug as a potential COVID-19 treatment. They then licensed the drug to Ridgeback and partner Merck.

Last week, Merck agreed to allow other drugmakers to make its COVID-19 pill, in a move aimed at helping millions of people in poorer countries get access. The Medicines Patent Pool, a U.N.-backed group, said Merck will not receive royalties under the agreement for as long as the World Health Organization deems COVID-19 to be a global emergency.

But the deal was criticized by some activists for excluding many middle-income countries capable of making millions of treatments, including Brazil and China.

Still, experts commended Merck for agreeing to widely share its formula and promising to help any companies who need technological help in making their drug — something no coronavirus vaccine producers have agreed to.

“Unlike the grotesquely unequal distribution of COVID-19 vaccines, the poorest countries will not have to wait at the back of the queue for molnupiravir,” said Dr. Mohga Kamal-Yanni, a senior health adviser to the People’s Vaccine Alliance. Fewer than 1% of the world’s COVID-19 vaccines have gone to poor countries and experts hope easier-to-dispense treatments will help them curb the pandemic.

Merck previously announced licensing deals with several Indian makers of generic drugs to manufacture lower-cost versions of molnupiravir for developing countries.

The U.S. has agreed to pay roughly $700 per course of the drug for about 1.7 million treatments. Merck says it plans to use a tiered pricing strategy for developing countries. A review by Harvard University and King’s College London estimated the drug costs about $18 to make each 40-pill course of treatment.

While other treatments have been cleared to treat COVID-19, including steroids and monoclonal antibodies, those are administered by injection or infusion and are mostly used in hospitals and other health care facilities.

LONDON (AP) — Northern Ireland’s health minister is suing Van Morrison after the singer called him “very dangerous” for his handling of coronavirus restrictions.

The Belfast-born singer opposes restrictions to curb the spread of the virus, and has released several songs criticizing lockdowns. He denounced Northern Ireland Health Minister Robin Swann during a gathering at Belfast’s Europa Hotel in June after a Morrison concert was canceled at the last minute because of virus restrictions.

The defamation suit relates to three incidents in which Morrison criticized Swann, calling him “a fraud” and “very dangerous.”

Swann responded in an article for Rolling Stone magazine, calling the “Moondance” singer’s claims “bizarre and irresponsible.”

Swann’s lawyer, Paul Tweed, said proceedings “are at an advanced stage with an anticipated hearing date early in 2022.” The lawsuit was first reported in the Sunday Life newspaper.

Morrison’s lawyer, Joe Rice, said the singer would contest the claim. He said Morrison will argue “that the words used by him related to a matter of public interest and constituted fair comment.”"

BERLIN (AP) — Germany’s disease control center is calling for people to cancel or avoid large events and to reduce their contacts as the country’s coronavirus infection rate hits the latest in a string of new highs.

The center, the Robert Koch Institute, said Friday that Germany’s infection rate climbed to 263.7 new cases per 100,000 residents over seven days, up from 249.1 the previous day.

Germany reported 48,640 new cases Friday, a day after the daily total topped 50,000 for the first time. Another 191 COVID-19 deaths brought Germany’s total in the pandemic so far to 97,389.

While the infection rate isn’t yet as high as in some other European countries, its relentless rise in Germany has set off alarm bells. Outgoing Chancellor Angela Merkel plans to meet with the country’s 16 state governors to coordinate nationwide measures next week, and parliament is mulling legislation that would provide a new legal framework for restrictions over the winter.

“We must now do everything necessary to break this momentum,” Health Minister Jens Spahn told reporters. “Otherwise it will be a bitter December for the whole country.”

In its weekly report released late Thursday, the Robert Koch Institute said it “urgently advises canceling or avoiding larger events if possible, but also reducing all other unnecessary contacts.” If such events can’t be avoided, it added, people should take a test before attending, regardless of whether they are vaccinated.

The head of the institute, Lothar Wieler, said Friday that there are fewer usable hospital beds than at any time during the pandemic, with more than half of intensive care units reporting “acute staff shortages,” as they did during Germany’s previous peak in January.

In the worst-affected areas, he said, the number of people attending large events should be reduced or authorities should consider banning such events and closing bars or clubs.

Most German regions restrict access to many indoor facilities and events to people who have been vaccinated against the virus, have recovered from COVID-19 or recently received negative test results — with the latter category now being excluded in an increasing number of areas. But enforcement is often slack.

Germany has struggled to bring new momentum to its vaccination campaign lately, with a bit over two-thirds of the population fully vaccinated, and has balked so far at ordering vaccine mandates for any professional group. Officials also want to ensure more people who were inoculated months ago get booster shots.

Spahn said he will order the revival of free rapid COVID-19 tests, which were scrapped a month ago in an effort to persuade more people to get vaccinated, effective Saturday.

He said he favors limiting public events to the vaccinated and those who have recovered from COVID-19, and also requiring them to be tested beforehand.

Germany on Friday declared neighboring Austria , whose infection rate is far higher, a “high-risk area” effective Sunday. That means people arriving from Austria who haven’t been vaccinated or haven’t recovered recently from COVID-19 will have to go into quarantine.

The Czech Republic and Hungary also were added to the list of “high-risk areas,” but the United States was removed.

The contagious delta variant is driving up COVID-19 hospitalizations in the Mountain West and fueling disruptive outbreaks in the North, a worrisome sign of what could be ahead this winter in the U.S.

While trends are improving in Florida, Texas and other Southern states that bore the worst of the summer surge, it’s clear that delta isn’t done with the United States. COVID-19 is moving north and west for the winter as people head indoors, close their windows and breathe stagnant air.

“We’re going to see a lot of outbreaks in unvaccinated people that will result in serious illness, and it will be tragic,” said Dr. Donald Milton of the University of Maryland School of Public Health.

In recent days, a Vermont college suspended social gatherings after a spike in cases tied to Halloween parties. Boston officials shut down an elementary school to control an outbreak. Hospitals in New Mexico and Colorado are overwhelmed.

In Michigan, the three-county metro Detroit area is again becoming a hot spot for transmissions, with one hospital system reporting nearly 400 COVID-19 patients. Mask-wearing in Michigan has declined to about 25% of people, according to a combination of surveys tracked by an influential modeling group at the University of Washington.

“Concern over COVID in general is pretty much gone, which is unfortunate,” said Dr. Jennifer Morse, medical director at health departments in 20 central and northern Michigan counties. “I feel strange going into a store masked. I’m a minority. It’s very different. It’s just a really unusual atmosphere right now.”

New Mexico is running out of intensive care beds despite the state’s above-average vaccination rate. Waning immunity may be playing a role. People who were vaccinated early and have not yet received booster shots may be driving up infection numbers, even if they still have some protection from the most dire consequences of the virus.

“Delta and waning immunity — the combination of these two have set us back,” said Ali Mokdad, a professor of health metrics sciences at the University of Washington. “This virus is going to stick with us for a long, long time.”

The delta variant dominates infections across the U.S., accounting for more than 99% of the samples analyzed.

No state has achieved a high enough vaccination rate, even when combined with infection-induced immunity, to avoid the type of outbreaks happening now, Mokdad said.

In a deviation from national recommendations, Colorado Gov. Jared Polis signed an executive order Thursday that allows any resident 18 or older access to a COVID-19 booster shot, another step to prevent hospitals and health care workers from being overwhelmed by the state’s surge in delta infections.

Progress on vaccination continues, yet nearly 60 million Americans age 12 and older remain unvaccinated. That’s an improvement since July, when 100 million were unvaccinated, said White House COVID-19 coordinator Jeff Zients.

First shots are averaging about 300,000 per day, and the effort to vaccinate children ages 5 to 11 is off to a strong start, Zients said at a briefing Wednesday.

Virginia Tech’s Linsey Marr, a leading researcher on the airborne spread of the coronavirus, predicted the northward spread of the virus in a Twitter post Sept. 15. The virus spreads in the air and can build up in enclosed rooms with poor ventilation. Colder weather means more people are indoors breathing the same air, Marr said.

Imagine that everyone you spend time with is a smoker and you want to breathe as little of their smoke as possible, she said.

“The closer you are to a smoker the more exposure you have to that smoke,” Marr said. “And if you’re in a poorly ventilated room, the smoke builds up over time.”

Marr said she and her vaccinated family will use rapid tests before gathering for Christmas to check for infection.

“It’s hard to know what’s coming next with this virus,” Marr said. “We thought we knew, but delta really surprised us. We thought the vaccine would help end this, but things are still dragging on. It’s hard to know what’s going to happen next.”

Officer Jack Nyce, 46, tested positive on Nov. 2 and died Saturday at a hospital in Manteca, his wife, Melissa Nyce, told the newspaper Monday.

The Chronicle said Melissa Nyce declined to say whether her husband was vaccinated but the vice president of the San Francisco Police Officers Association, Lt. Tracy McCray, said Jack Nyce was on a 30-day stint of paid administrative leave because he had not received the vaccination required by the city.

The death comes as mandates for government employee vaccinations are seeing some push-back.

The San Francisco Police Department said last week that as many as 70 sworn and civilian workers had been placed on leave for not meeting a Nov. 1 vaccination deadline. A press release said that as of Nov. 2, 97.5% of department employees were fully vaccinated.

Any officers who remain unvaccinated by Nov. 13 will be placed on unpaid administrative leave until the San Francisco Police Commission convenes a hearing.

Jack Nyce was a 17-year employee of the department.

“He loved being a cop,” his widow said."

Hugs with friends. Birthday parties indoors. Pillow fights. Schoolchildren who got their first COVID-19 shots Wednesday said these are the pleasures they look forward to as the U.S. enters a major new phase in fighting the pandemic.

Health officials hailed shots for kids ages 5 to 11 as a major breakthrough after more than 18 months of illness, hospitalizations, deaths and disrupted education.

Kid-sized doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine cleared two final hurdles Tuesday — a recommendation from CDC advisers, followed by a green light from Dr. Rochelle Walensky, director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

At a Decatur, Georgia, pediatrician’s office, 10-year-old Mackenzie Olson took off her black leather jacket and rolled up her sleeve as her mother looked on.

“I see my friends but not the way I want to. I want to hug them, play games with them that we don’t normally get to,” and have a pillow fight with her best friend, Mackenzie said after getting her shot at the Children’s Medical Group site.

With the federal government promising enough vaccine to protect the nation’s 28 million kids in this age group, pediatricians’ offices and hospitals began inoculating children. Schools, pharmacies and other locations plan to follow suit in the days ahead.

The atmosphere surrounding the launch of shots for elementary-age students was festive in many locations. California vaccine sites welcomed children with inflatable animals and handed out coloring books and prizes. Vehicles lined up before dawn at an Atlanta site.

Many pediatricians’ offices expected strong interest in the shots at least initially, but health officials are worried about demand tapering off. Almost two-thirds of parents recently polled by the Kaiser Family Foundation said they would wait or not seek out vaccines for their kids.

Brian Giglio, 40, of Alexandria, Virginia, brought his 8-year-old son, Carter, in for vaccination at Children’s National Hospital in Washington, where kids with underlying conditions got first dibs. Carter has Type 1 diabetes that puts him at risk for complications if he were to become infected.

Giglio said the vaccine was “like a hallway pass for us to begin living life again.” And Carter said he can’t wait to leave masks behind once he’s fully vaccinated, so he can smell the things he used to be able to smell without it.

“I’m ready to trash it,” he said, though the CDC still recommends masks in schools and indoor public spaces where virus activity is high, even for the fully vaccinated.

Cate Zeigler-Amon, 10, was first in line Wednesday for a drive-through vaccination at Viral Solutions in Atlanta. The girl enthusiastically bounced around the car before the shot, which she broadcast live on her computer during morning announcements at her elementary school.

Afterward, Cate said she was looking forward to hugging her friends and celebrating her birthday indoors next month “instead of having a freezing cold outside birthday party.”

Hartford Hospital in Connecticut vaccinated seven youngsters Tuesday night, minutes after the CDC’s director gave the OK, and three more early Wednesday. As they got their shots, one girl squeezed her eyes shut and a boy barely flinched, and other waiting kids applauded.

ADVERTISEMENT

The vaccine — one-third the dose given to older children and adults and administered with kid-sized needles — requires two doses three weeks apart, plus two more weeks for full protection. That means children who get vaccinated before Thanksgiving will be covered by Christmas.

“The timing before winter holidays is very fortunate,” said Dr. Jennifer Shu, whose Children’s Medical Group office in Decatur, Georgia, began vaccinating first thing Wednesday. “This age group will be able to spend holidays with friends and family more safely than they have been able to since the start of the pandemic.”

Thousands of pediatricians pre-ordered doses, and Pfizer began shipments soon after the Food and Drug Administration’s decision Friday to authorize emergency use. Pfizer said it expects to make 19,000 shipments totaling about 11 million doses in the coming days, and millions more will be available to order on a weekly basis.

Authorities said they expect a smooth rollout, unlike the chaos that plagued the national one for adults nearly a year ago.

Asked about parents having trouble finding vaccine appointments, White House coronavirus coordinator Jeff Zients said the vaccines.gov website will be updated by Friday for parents to search for locations near them. He said the kid vaccination campaign will be at full speed next week as Pfizer continues to ship millions more doses to locations around the country.

More than 6,000 vaccination clinics are being planned at schools around the country before the winter holiday break, he said.

Walgreens planned to start kids’ vaccinations Saturday and said parents could sign up online or by calling 1-800-Walgreens. CVS was also accepting appointments online and by phone at select pharmacies starting Sunday.

Despite the initial enthusiasm, not everyone is rushing out to get shots.

Hannah Hause, a Colorado mother of four children ages 2, 5, 7 and 8, is herself vaccinated, but wants to see how the child vaccines play out and are studied in the larger childhood population.

“It’s not studied long-term. It just makes me nervous,” she said. “As long as I can wait, I will wait.”

At a White House briefing Wednesday, Walensky said authorities thoroughly reviewed all available data on the vaccine’s safety, efficacy and the immune response it generates before recommending shots for kids.

Dr. Ada Stewart, a Black family physician in Columbia, South Carolina, and past president of the American Academy of Family Physicians, said she’s seen the toll the virus has taken on younger children — not just in family illness and death but with school disruptions, slipping grades and mental strain.

School closures throughout the pandemic have disproportionately burdened children of color, widening academic gaps and worsening mental health, according to data presented Tuesday to CDC advisers. It showed more than 2,000 COVID-related school closures in just the first two months of the current school year.

A Pfizer study of 2,268 children found the vaccine was almost 91% effective at preventing symptomatic COVID-19 infections. The FDA examined 3,100 vaccinated kids in concluding the shots are safe.

Some skeptics have questioned the need for kids to get vaccinated since they are less likely than adults to develop severe COVID-19. But with the delta variant, they get infected and transmit “just as readily as adults do,” Dr. Anthony Fauci said at a recent White House briefing.

Infected kids have also contributed to the U.S. toll — almost 46 million infections and more than 740,000 deaths.

Since the pandemic began, at least 94 children ages 5 to 11 have died from COVID-19, more than 8,300 have been hospitalized and over 5,000 have developed a serious inflammatory condition linked to the coronavirus. Black and Latino youngsters and those with chronic conditions are among the hardest hit.

Full Coverage: Coronavirus vaccine

Kye’vontay Jordan, 7, who is Black, has diabetes and got his shot at Children’s National Hospital in Washington. The vaccine gave his dad peace of mind.

“Now I can sleep not worrying about him going to school,” said Brian Jordan. “Being exposed to the coronavirus could really affect him and mess him up.”

WASHINGTON (AP) — Nearly 8,500 active duty members of the Air Force and Space Force have missed the deadline for getting COVID-19 vaccinations, including 800 who flatly refused and nearly 5,000 with pending requests for a religious exemption, the Air Force said Wednesday.

The Air Force said that of the 326,000 active duty members of the Air Force and Space Force, 95.9 percent are fully vaccinated and 96.9 percent have gotten at least one shot.

“A vaccinated force is a protected force, better able to deploy and to defend our interests anywhere at any time,” said Ann Stefanek, an Air Force spokeswoman. “Receiving the COVID-19 vaccine is a necessary requirement to keep our people safe and healthy. This is a readiness issue.”

Tuesday was the Air Force deadline for all active duty members to receive vaccinations. The Air Force deadline was the first of all the military services, providing an initial glimpse into how America’s military will handle the mandate.

ADVERTISEMENT

The Air Force said 8,486 service members had not been vaccinated as of Tuesday. Of that total, 800 had “verbally refused.” Another 2,753 had not started the vaccination process for reasons not cited in the Air Force announcement, and 4,933 have pending requests for exemption on religious grounds.

The Air Force said that by Dec. 2 it would complete its review of requests for medical and religious exemptions. Thus far, a total of 1,866 requests for medical or administrative exemptions have been approved. It said zero requests for religious exemptions have been approved.

This sets thousands of disciplinary actions in motion and sets the stage for exemption procedures that could drag on for weeks.

The vaccination deadline for the Air Guard and Reserve is Dec. 2."

(AP Photo/Ted Shaffrey, File)

NEW YORK (AP) — People who trust Fox News Channel and other media outlets that appeal to conservatives are more likely to believe falsehoods about COVID-19 and vaccines than those who primarily go elsewhere for news, a study has found.

While the Kaiser Family Foundation study released this week found the clear ties between news outlets that people trusted and the amount of misinformation they believe, it took no stand on whether those attitudes specifically came from what they saw there.

“It may be because the people who are self-selecting these organizations believe (the misinformation) going in,” said Liz Hamel, vice president and director of public opinion and survey research at Kaiser.

Kaiser polled people on whether or not they believed seven widely-circulated untruths about the virus, among them that the government is exaggerating the number of deaths attributable to the coronavirus, hiding reports of deaths caused by vaccines or that the vaccines can cause infertility, contain a microchip or can change DNA.

ADVERTISEMENT

For people who most trusted network or local television news, NPR, CNN or MSNBC, between 11% and 16% said they believed four or more of those untrue statements, or weren’t sure about what was true.

For Fox News viewers, 36% either believed in or were unsure about four or more false statements, Kaiser said. It was 46% for Newsmax viewers and 37% for those who said they trusted One America Network News.

The most widely-believed falsehood is about the government exaggerating COVID deaths. Kaiser said 60% of Americans either believe that or said they didn’t know whether or not it was true.

A sharp partisan divide on trust in news outlets has been evident for years, and Kaiser said this extends to COVID-19 news. Kaiser found, for example, that 65% of Democrats say they believe what they hear about COVID-19 on CNN, while only 17% of Republicans do. Roughly half of Republicans believe what they hear about the coronavirus on Fox, while only 18% of Democrats do.

The extent to which COVID-19 has become a political battleground is evident nearly every day. Most recently, some Republicans complained about “government propaganda” after the “Sesame Street” Muppet character Big Bird tweeted about getting vaccinated.

A Fox News spokeswoman would not comment directly on Kaiser’s findings on Tuesday, but pointed to several network personalities who have spoken out in favor of getting vaccinated. Most recently it was Neil Cavuto, a multiple sclerosis sufferer who came down with the disease but had a mild case because he was vaccinated. He pleaded with viewers to get the shot: “Life is too short to be an ass,” he said.

Yet vaccine and mandate skepticism has been a steady drumbeat on several Fox shows.

Newsmax issued a statement that the network “strongly supports the COVID vaccine, has encouraged its viewers to get the vaccine and has on air only medical experts that support the vaccine.”

The company last week took its White House correspondent, Emerald Robinson, off the air for an investigation after she tweeted: “Dear Christians: The vaccines contain a bioluminescent marker called Luciferase so that you can be tracked.” She remained grounded on Tuesday.

Hamel said Kaiser’s findings on attitudes of people who have not been vaccinated illustrate a real challenge faced by public health authorities. Their distrust of COVID-19 news ran wide and deep: the highest percentage of unvaccinated people who said they trusted what an outlet said on the topic was the 30% who cited Fox.

“The one thing I did not realize going in was how little trust there was across news sources among unvaccinated people,” she said.

Among social media outlets like Facebook and Twitter, the trust numbers were particularly small. But Hamel said that doesn’t mean social media hasn’t had a big impact in spreading stories that sow doubt about the vaccines.

Kaiser’s study was conducted between Oct. 14-24 in a random telephone sample of 1,519 American adults."

BERLIN (AP) — Austria’s chancellor on Thursday stepped up threats of lockdown measures for unvaccinated people, as new coronavirus cases in the Alpine nation are soaring. The country’s worst-affected province said it plans to take that step next week.

Austria has taken a series of measures in recent weeks in an effort to curb the spread of COVID-19 and encourage more people to get vaccinated. On Monday, new rules took effect barring unvaccinated people who haven’t recovered from an infection from restaurants, hotels, hairdressing salons and large public events.

Chancellor Alexander Schallenberg said late last month that unvaccinated people in Austria could face new lockdown restrictions if infection numbers continue to rise — which they have. On Thursday, official figures showed 760.6 reported new cases per 100,000 residents over the previous seven days — a rate three times that of neighboring Germany, where record numbers also are causing alarm.

During a visit Thursday to Bregenz in western Austria, Schallenberg said that a lockdown for the unvaccinated is “probably unavoidable” and that the unvaccinated face an “uncomfortable” winter and Christmas, the Austria Press Agency reported.

“I don’t see why two-thirds should lose their freedom because one-third is dithering,” Schallenberg said. “For me, it is clear that there should be no lockdown for the vaccinated out of solidarity for the unvaccinated.”

Upper Austria province, the country’s worst-affected region with nearly 1,200 new cases per 100,000 residents over the past week, said later Thursday that it plans to take the lead.

Officials there “plan a lockdown for unvaccinated people from Monday, provided that there is a legal green light from the federal government, or rather that the federal government creates the legal basis,” governor Thomas Stelzer said.

Schallenberg said authorities would consider a vaccine mandate for some professional groups. He added that the country’s vaccination rate is “shamefully low.” About 65% of the population is fully inoculated.

The chancellor insisted that “we can break this wave together.”

Millions of U.S. workers now have a Jan 4. deadline to get a COVID vaccine.

The federal government on Thursday announced new vaccine requirements for workers at companies with more than 100 employees as well as for workers at health care facilities that treat Medicare and Medicaid patients. It also extended a deadline for federal contractors.

The Biden administration says 70% of all adult Americans are now fully vaccinated. The new rules are aimed at the tens of millions who remain unvaccinated.

Here are the key takeaways:

___

WHAT DO COMPANIES HAVE TO DO?

Companies with 100 or more employees must require those workers to get fully vaccinated — with two shots of the Moderna or Pfizer vaccines, or one shot of Johnson & Johnson — by Jan. 4. After that date, any employee who remains unvaccinated must provide a verified negative COVID test weekly. Companies aren’t required to pay for those tests. Unvaccinated employees also must wear masks.

ADVERTISEMENT

___

WHAT ABOUT PEOPLE WHO WORK AT HOME?

The requirements don’t apply to people who work at home or who work outdoors.

___

WILL WORKERS GET TIME OFF TO GET VACCINATED?

Starting Dec. 5, employers must offer paid time off for workers to get vaccinated and sick leave if workers experience vaccine side effects.

___

HOW WILL THIS BE ENFORCED?

The Occupational Safety and Health Administration will assist companies with vaccination plans. It will also enforce the rules. Fines for non-compliance will vary based on a company’s size and other factors, but companies might have to pay up to $13,653 per individual violator. But enforcement will be difficult. OSHA has only around 1,850 inspectors to oversee 130 million workers at 8 million companies.

___

IS THIS LEGAL?

OSHA says it’s on sound legal footing, and has the emergency authority to issue rules that protect workers from an imminent health hazard. It also says the rules pre-empt all state law. Several states and Republican governors have threatened to sue, contending the government doesn’t have the power to make such rules.

___

WHAT ABOUT SMALLER COMPANIES?

OSHA said Thursday that the mandate could be expanded to companies with fewer than 100 workers. The agency said it will make a decision after collecting public comment on that proposal for the next 30 days.

___

WHAT ARE THE RULES FOR HEALTH CARE WORKERS?

Workers at health care facilities that treat Medicaid and Medicare patients must be fully vaccinated by Jan. 4. There is no weekly testing option for those workers, but they can ask for religious or medical exemptions. The mandate will cover about 17 million health care workers at hospitals, nursing homes, surgical centers and other facilities.

___

WHAT ABOUT FEDERAL CONTRACTORS?

In September, the Biden administration said it would require employees at federal contractors to get vaccinated by Dec. 8. On Thursday, the government pushed back that deadline to Jan. 4."

WASHINGTON (AP) — President Joe Biden is pushing forward with a massive plan to require millions of private sector employees to get vaccinated by early next year. But first, he has to make sure workers in his own federal government get the shot.

About 4 million federal workers are to be vaccinated by Nov. 22 under the president’s executive order. Some employees, like those at the White House, are nearly all vaccinated. But the rates are lower at other federal agencies, particularly those related to law enforcement and intelligence, according to the agencies and union leaders. And some resistant workers are digging in, filing lawsuits and protesting what they say is unfair overreach by the White House.

The upcoming deadline is the first test of Biden’s push to compel people to get vaccinated. Beyond the federal worker rule, another mandate will take effect in January aimed at around 84 million private sector workers, according to guidelines put out this past week.

ADVERTISEMENT

On Saturday, a federal appeals court in Louisiana temporarily halted the vaccine requirement for businesses with 100 or more workers. The administration says it is confident that the requirement will withstand legal challenges in part because its safety rules preempt state laws.

“The president and the administration wouldn’t have put these requirements in place if they didn’t think that they were appropriate and necessary,” Surgeon General Vivek Murthy said Sunday on ABC’s “This Week.” “And the administration is certainly prepared to defend them.”

If the mandates are a success, they could make the most serious dent in new coronavirus cases since the vaccine first became available, especially with the news this past week that children ages 5-11 can get the shot making an additional 64 million people eligible. But with two weeks remaining until the federal worker deadline, some leaders of unions representing the employees say that convincing the unvaccinated to change their mind is increasingly challenging.

“I got the vaccine in February, it was my own choice and I thought it would stop the virus,” said Corey Trammel, a Bureau of Prisons correctional officer and local union president in Louisiana. “But it hasn’t. And now I have people resigning because they are tired of the government overreach on this, they do not want to get the shot. People just don’t trust the government, and they just don’t trust this vaccine.”

Vaccines have a proven track record of safety, backed by clinical trials and independent reviews showing them overwhelmingly effective at preventing serious illness and death from COVID-19. More than 222 million Americans have received at least one vaccine dose and more than 193 million are fully vaccinated. More than half of the world population has also received a shot.

Scientists have been battling anxiety over the vaccine since it was first authorized; an AP-NORC poll earlier this year found one-third of adults in the U.S. were skeptical, despite assurances the vaccine was safe and effective and few instances of serious side effects. About 70% of American adults are fully vaccinated and 80% have received at least one dose of a vaccine.

Vaccinations have unfolded at uneven rates across the federal government.

Officials at Health and Human Services, U.S. Food and Drug Administration and Housing and Urban Development said they were working on getting their employees vaccinated but had no figures yet.

Several intelligence agencies had at least 20% of their workforce unvaccinated as of late October, said U.S. Rep. Chris Stewart, a Utah Republican who is a member of the House Intelligence Committee.

Federal Law Enforcement Officers Association President Larry Cosme said there are about 31,000 members from 65 federal law enforcement agencies in the association and he estimated 60% of them have been vaccinated.

Homeland Security, a giant government department with more than 240,000 employees, was about 64% fully vaccinated by the end of last month. U.S. Customs and Border Protection has received at least 6,000 requests for medical or religious exemptions, according to the union that represents Border Patrol agents.

Federal agencies are warning employees about the upcoming mandate, offering time off to get the vaccine and encouraging workers to comply. But they won’t be fired if they don’t make the Nov. 22 deadline. They would receive “counseling” and be given five days to start the vaccination process. They could then be suspended for 14 days and eventually could be terminated, but that process would take months.

Republicans have argued the mandate goes too far. House Oversight Committee Republicans sent a letter in late October suggesting the president’s “authoritarian and extreme mandates infringe upon American freedoms, are unprecedented, and may ultimately be deemed unlawful.”

In their letter, Reps. James Comer of Kentucky and Jody Hice of Georgia said they worried about a large number of government vacancies should thousands of workers refuse and get fired. That concern was also felt by those in the already-understaffed Bureau of Prisons.

A federal corrections officers union in Florida filed a lawsuit this past week over the mandate, saying it was a violation of civil rights. Some prison workers say they’re torn about the vaccine, not wanting to lose their livelihoods but also unwilling to sacrifice their personal beliefs. Officers near retirement age are contemplating leaving rather than go through with the vaccine.

One prison worker in West Virginia texted a colleague that the worker wasn’t willing to be a guinea pig, writing: “It would be different if it wasn’t new. But it is. And I don’t wanna be your experiment.”

The worker, describing how agonizing the decision had been, said: “I’ve cried and puked so much my eyes and stomach hurts.” The worker wondered if it was wrong to stand firm against the vaccine.

Border Patrol employees have been directed to confirm their vaccination status by Tuesday, according to union President Brandon Judd. As of Thursday, 49% of Border Patrol agents responded to say they are fully vaccinated and about 7% reported not being vaccinated, Judd said.

It’s unclear at this point how many will continue to refuse if they aren’t granted an exemption and face losing their job as a result.

“When it comes down to losing your livelihood or getting vaccinated, I think the vast majority are going to ultimately get vaccinated,” Judd said. “We are going to lose people. How many? I really couldn’t predict that.”

BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) — As COVID-19 ravaged Hungary in April, Budapest resident Akos Sipos received his second vaccine dose, believing he was doing the right thing for his own health and to help end the pandemic.

But Sipos, 46, soon discovered that the vaccine he received, Russia’s Sputnik V, disqualified him from traveling to a number of other countries where it hadn’t been approved. The nations include the United States, which is pushing forward with a new air travel policy that will make Sipos and many like him ineligible to enter.

“I thought it’s better to get Sputnik today than a Western vaccine at some uncertain future time,” Sipos, who works as a search engine optimization specialist, said of his initial decision to receive the jab. “But I couldn’t have known at that time that I wouldn’t be able to travel with Sputnik.”

Starting Monday, the United States plans to reopen to foreign travelers who are fully vaccinated against the coronavirus. But there’s a catch: non-immigrant adults need to have received vaccines authorized by the Food and Drug Administration or which received an emergency use listing from the World Health Organization.

ADVERTISEMENT

That leaves many hopeful travelers across the globe who have taken full courses of vaccines widely used in other parts of the world — Sputnik V and the China-produced CanSino jab, in particular — scrambling to get reinoculated with shots approved by U.S. authorities.

Two other Chinese vaccines, Sinopharm and Sinovac, have been approved by the WHO and will thus be accepted for travel into the U.S.

Mexico received nearly 12 million doses of CanSino and almost 20 million of Sputnik V after shipments began earlier this year. Residents who got the required two shots of those vaccines now are looking to top up with shots of the Pfizer, Moderna, AstraZeneca or Johnson & Johnson vaccines, hoping that will make them eligible to cross the border.

“They screwed those of us who got this vaccine,” said Rosenda Ruiz, 52, a public relations manager in Mexico City who received Sputnik V. “There are lots of Mexicans who want to travel, but we can’t. I am thinking of getting whatever other vaccine I can get.”

While Sputnik V is used in around 70 countries worldwide, it has still not been approved by either the FDA or the U.N. health agency. Nearly 1 million people have received the vaccine in Hungary, a Central European country of around 10 million.

Hungary was one of only two countries in the 27-member European Union to roll out the Russian vaccine. Fewer than 20,000 people received it in Slovakia.

Judit Molnar, president of the Association of Hungarian Travel Agencies, says so many Hungarians being unable to travel to the United States — or even to some countries in the EU which don’t accept the jab — has had an effect on her industry.

ADVERTISEMENT

“We see that in the last few months, travelers are increasingly asking us when they can travel to America,” said Molnar, who is also president of the OTP Travel agency.

“These travelers are saying they really hope the situation will change and that the United States will accept the Sputnik vaccine. There are many people who would like to travel and in Hungary, many people were vaccinated with Sputnik,” she said.

Citizens of Russia, where use of Sputnik V is most widespread, also are seeking Western-approved shots so they can travel abroad. Faced with the prospect of being turned away from flights, Russians have booked tours to Serbia , which has authorized use of the Pfizer-BioNTech, China’s Sinopharm and the AstraZeneca vaccines in addition to Sputnik V.

Russia, which unveiled Sputnik V with much fanfare as the world’s first registered vaccine in August 2020, criticized U.S. plans to leave the vaccine off its list of approved shots.

“There are exactly zero reasons for such decisions,” Leonid Slutsky, chairman of the foreign relations committee in the Russian Duma, or lower house of parliament. “The effectiveness and safety of the Sputnik V vaccine has been proven not only by specialists, but also by its practical application.”

But the World Health Organization still is reviewing the vaccine , and months of holdups make it unclear when Sputnik V might receive an emergency use listing.

Hungary’s government has made bilateral agreements with 24 countries — including Russia, Serbia, Mongolia, Georgia, and Kazakhstan — on mutually recognizing proof of vaccination, regardless of vaccine type.

Hungary’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs told The Associated Press that it is open to a similar agreement with the United States, but “currently there is no ongoing negotiation.”

Sipos, the search engine specialist, said that while he was confident in Sputnik V’s efficacy, he recently sought a Western-approved booster shot, Moderna, so he could travel where he wants.

“I felt deceived because they accept Sputnik in more than 60 countries in the world, but in tons of other countries they don’t,” he said.

Silvia Morales, 38, a public high school teacher in Monterrey, Mexico, said she recently received a Moderna shot after hearing that the U.S. government wouldn’t recognize her CanSino vaccine.

She said she “needed to have peace of mind” about her level of protection against the virus.

“But I also love traveling to the United States,” she said.

THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) — Santa won’t be getting his traditional welcome in the Dutch city of Utrecht this year. The ceremonial head of Carnival celebrations in Germany’s Cologne had to bow out because he tested positive for COVID-19. And Austria is planning a lockdown on unvaccinated people in two hard-hit regions.

Nearly two years into a global health crisis that has killed more than 5 million people, infections are again sweeping across parts of Western Europe, a region with relatively high vaccination rates and good health care systems but where lockdown measures are largely a thing of the past.

The World Health Organization said coronavirus deaths rose by 10% in Europe in the past week , and an agency official declared last week that the continent was “back at the epicenter of the pandemic.” Much of that is being driven by spiraling outbreaks in Russia and Eastern Europe — where vaccination rates tend to be low — but countries in the west such as Germany and Britain recorded some of the highest new case tolls in the world.

ADVERTISEMENT

While nations in Western Europe all have vaccination rates over 60% — and some like Portugal and Spain are much higher — that still leaves a significant portion of their populations without protection.

Dr. Bharat Pankhania, senior clinical lecturer at Exeter University College of Medicine and Health, says that the large number of unvaccinated people combined with a widespread post-lockdown resumption of socializing and a slight decline in immunity for people who got their shots months ago is driving up the pace of infections.

Thanks largely to vaccination, hospitals in Western Europe are not under the same pressure they were earlier in the pandemic, but many are still straining to handle rising numbers of COVID patients while also attempting to clear backlogs of tests and surgeries with exhausted or sick staff. Even the countries experiencing the most serious outbreaks in the region recorded far fewer deaths per person over the past four weeks than the United States did, according to data from Johns Hopkins University.

The question now is if countries can tamp down this latest upswing without resorting to stringent shutdowns that devastated economies, disrupted education and weighed on mental health. Experts say probably — but authorities can’t avoid all restrictions and must boost vaccination rates.

ADVERTISEMENT

“I think the era of locking people up in their homes is over because we now have tools to control COVID — the testing, vaccines and therapeutics,” said Devi Sridhar, chair of global public health at the University of Edinburgh. “So I hope people will do the things they have to do, like put on a mask.”

Many European countries now use COVID passes — proof of full vaccination, recovery from the virus or a negative test result — to access venues like bars and restaurants. Pankhania warned that the passes can give a false sense of security since fully vaccinated people can still get infected, though their chances of dying or getting seriously sick are dramatically lower.

But restrictions don’t go much further these days, although the Dutch government on Friday announced a three-week partial lockdown.

“Tonight we have a very unpleasant message with very unpleasant and far-reaching decisions,” caretaker Prime Minister Mark Rutte said.

German lawmakers are mulling legislation that would pave the way for new measures. Austrian Chancellor Alexander Schallenberg announced Friday that unvaccinated people in two regions will only be able to leave home for specified reasons starting Monday, and he is considering implementing similar measures nationwide. But he has said he doesn’t want to impose the restrictions on those who got the shot.

Austria is seeing one of the most serious outbreaks in Western Europe, along with Germany, which has reported a string of record-high infections in recent days.

“We have a real emergency situation right now,” said Christian Drosten, the head of virology at Berlin’s Charite Hospital, which has started canceling scheduled surgeries.

Duesseldorf’s university hospital said earlier this week that its ICU is full, though many facilities are struggling more with staff shortages than bed space.

Drosten said Germany must increase its vaccination rate of 67% further — and fast. But officials have balked at ordering vaccine mandates and want to avoid any blanket lockdowns.

Health Minister Jens Spahn indicated that Germany could improve its often lax enforcement of COVID pass requirements.

“If my vaccination certificate is checked more often in one day in Rome than it sometimes is in four weeks in Germany, then I think more can be done,” Spahn said recently.

The Netherlands is in a similar bind: The country announced the highest daily tally of new cases since the pandemic began Thursday, hospitals are warning the situation could get worse, but officials are reluctant to clamp down too hard. Amid these concerns, organizers in Utrecht said they couldn’t in good conscience bring tens of thousands of people together to greet Santa at the annual Sinterklaas party beloved of children.

Cities in Germany, by contrast, went ahead with outdoor Carnival celebrations this week — but the head of Cologne’s party, Carnival Prince Sven I., canceled public appearances after testing positive.

In the United Kingdom, which lifted remaining restrictions in July and has seen big spikes as well as dips in cases since, Prime Minister Boris Johnson insists the country can “live with the virus.” The government will only reimpose restrictions if the health service comes under “unsustainable” pressure, he says.

Spain, once one of Europe’s hardest hit nations, perhaps offers an example of how the risks can be managed.

It has vaccinated 80% of its population, and while face masks are no longer mandatory outdoors, many people still wear them. While infections have ticked up slightly recently, Rafael Bengoa, one of Spain’s leading public health experts, said that given the high vaccination rate, “the virus won’t be able to dominate us again.”

Several countries are hoping that pushing harder on immunizations will get them there. Germany plans to re-open vaccination centers across the country to speed booster shots. France is also pinning its hopes on booster doses while urging holdouts to get their first shots. Italy is also expanding its booster program as numbers edge higher.

Pankhania says that no single measure will control the pandemic.

“To really control it, it has to be multi-layered ... avoid crowds, avoid poorly ventilated places, be immunized, wear your mask,” he said.

The United States is steadily chipping away at vaccine hesitancy and driving down COVID-19 cases and hospitalizations to the point that schools, governments and corporations are lifting mask restrictions yet again.

Nearly 200 million Americans are fully vaccinated and the nation’s over-65 population, which bore the brunt of the pandemic when it started nearly two years ago, is enthusiastically embracing vaccines.

Nearly 98% of the over-65 population has received at least one COVID-19 shot and more than 25% of them have gotten boosters, just weeks after they were authorized. The improving metrics could get a boost from President Joe Biden’s workplace mandate unveiled Thursday and the launch of COVID-19 shots in elementary-age students .

Seniors also are playing a role in getting other family members vaccinated. Erin Lipsker plans to get her 8-year-old daughter and 5-year-old son vaccinated as soon as possible so they can see her parents and her 98-year-old grandmother. An added motivation is that Lipsker was treated for cancer two years ago, and her 8-year-old daughter, Kennedy, has asthma.

“The more children and adults are vaccinated, the quicker we will be able to resume a new normal. I want that for my kids. I want that for our planet,” said Lipsker, of Spokane, Washington. “I think I will feel much safer around our family. I have a 98-year-old grandmother that my kids adore. I will feel safer having my kids around her, and my parents.”

But the pandemic has proven hard to control. In the U.S., winter is coming and diseases like COVID-19 often spread easier with people indoors and closer together. The worst surge in the nation happened last winter, before the vaccines were widely available.

While cases around the world are declining, the World Health Organization said this week new cases jumped by 6% in Europe, compared with an 18% increase the previous week. The U.S. plans to open its borders to international travelers Monday.

The trends in the U.S. have health officials feeling better for the first time in months and hoping the progress will continue as long as a new variant doesn’t pop up or the rate of newly vaccinated people declines. But they have also been down this road before and have come to the conclusion that COVID-19 is going to be an issue for years to come.

“It is going to be endemic. It is going to exist in our population for a long period of time,” said Deborah Fuller, a professor of microbiology at the University of Washington. “You saw what looked like an inflection point coming and, boom, here came the delta variant.”

There are still plenty of encouraging signs in the U.S. Pfizer announced Friday its experimental pill for COVID-19 cut rates of hospitalization and death by nearly 90% among patients with mild-to-moderate infections and it will soon ask the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to authorize its pill.

The number of Americans in the hospital with COVID-19 is averaging around 42,000, the lowest number since the beginning of August, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The hospitalization dip matches a dip in overall cases.

But deaths, which lag behind increasing case counts because it can take weeks for the disease to kill, continue to mount. The U.S. is averaging 1,100 coronavirus deaths per day, down from more than 1,600 two weeks ago.

More than 750,000 people have died from COVID-19 in the U.S. in less than two years, about the population of Denver. The latest 50,000 deaths happened in the past month.

With hospital beds emptying, case counts declining and an increase in vaccinated people, however, it has been a slow return to a new normal. Louisiana’s Democratic Gov. John Bel Edwards last week ended a face covering requirement almost everywhere but schools, saying he was “optimistic, relieved that the worst of the fourth surge is very clearly behind us now.”

Memphis also ended its mask requirement, and so did a number of schools around Atlanta as the spread of the virus decreased. Amazon ended a mask mandate for most vaccinated workers in places where local or state rules don’t require them. Hawaii’s governor ended pandemic capacity limits on businesses like restaurants, bars and gyms, but owners must continue to enforce social distancing rules.

Color-coded virus maps that were a sea of red in September have started to turn yellow and blue in recent weeks, indicating a much slower spread of disease. The CDC says about 350 counties are now experiencing moderate or low transmission, many of them in the Deep South.

In the U.S., nearly 60% of the population — more than 193 million people — are fully vaccinated. More than 21 million have received a booster dose, and those numbers are soaring each day. The average number of Americans getting booster shots has reached nearly 800,000 per day. That compares with about 265,000 people per day getting their first shot.

It’s still too early to know how many children under 12 have gotten shots in the three days they have been available.

Lagging behind are Southern and more rural states and that rural divide even extends to states with higher vaccination rates like Maine, where more than 70% of the population is vaccinated. Many of the rural states are starting to experience cold weather that is driving people indoors and creating ripe conditions for more virus spread.

In Maine, the five counties with the lowest vaccination rates are rural ones along the border with Canada, where rates hover just over 60%.

“One theory is that residents of those counties feel less at risk of infection because they interact less often with others. Vaccine hesitancy among residents of those counties also seems to dovetail with political identity factors.” said Robert Long, a spokesperson for the Maine Center for Disease Control.

The national disease co… [+2885 chars]",Center,"BERLIN (AP) — Germany’s coronavirus infection rate climbed to its highest recorded level yet on Monday as what officials have called a “pandemic of the unvaccinated” gathers pace.

The national disease control center, the Robert Koch Institute, said the country has seen 201.1 new cases per 100,000 residents over the past seven days. That was above the previous record of 197.6 from Dec. 22 last year. While it’s still a lower rate than in several other European countries, it has set alarm bells ringing.

The seven-day infection rate has long ceased to be the only policy yardstick in Germany, with new hospital admissions now an important factor. Those are currently at just under 4 per 100,000 residents over a week — compared with a peak of about 15.5 last Christmas — but officials say hospitals are filling up in badly affected areas.

The disease control center said Monday that 15,513 new COVID-19 cases were reported over the past 24 hours — down from a record 37,120 on Friday, but figures are typically lower after the weekend. Another 33 deaths were recorded, bringing Germany’s total to 96,558.

Germany has struggled to find ways to pep up its much-slowed vaccination campaign. At least 67% of the population of 83 million is fully vaccinated, according to official figures, which authorities say isn’t enough. Unlike some other European countries, it has balked at making vaccinations mandatory for any professional group.

As at many times during the pandemic, Germany has a patchwork of regional rules. Most places restrict access to many indoor facilities and events to people who have been vaccinated, have recovered or been tested — with the latter now being excluded in some areas. Those rules are often enforced laxly.

Rules on whether schoolchildren must wear masks in class vary from state to state.

Free rapid tests for all were scrapped nearly a month ago in an effort to incentivize more people to get vaccinated. There are now widespread calls for them to be reintroduced. And officials now advocate booster vaccinations for everyone who got their initial shots six months ago or more.

Germany currently has a caretaker national government after its election in September. The parties that are expected to form the next government plan to bring legislation to parliament this week that would allow an “epidemic situation of national scope,” in place since March 2020, to expire at the end of the month but provide a new legal framework for coronavirus measures.

There has been criticism of that decision. But Katrin Goering-Eckardt, the parliamentary leader of one of those parties, the Greens, told ARD television that “we need to create measures now that can’t be questioned by courts.”

She argued that, with two-thirds of residents vaccinated, the current rules weren’t legally waterproof.

Schools and other facilities can be closed if necessary, but “with so many people vaccinated, we won’t be able legally to do a complete lockdown for those who are vaccinated,” Goering-Eckardt said.

John Bernardo, of West Haven, was arrested on a federal criminal complaint alleging wire fraud and conspiracy. He appeared before a federal judge in New Haven and posted $250,000 bail, the U.S. attorney’s office said.

Bernardo’s lawyer, Tara Knight, said her 65-year-old client has no criminal record and was a firefighter for 26 years.

“They’re serious charges, and it really is an obligation for an attorney to let the case play out in the courtroom, not in the media,” Knight said. “So I’m going to let it play out in the courtroom.”

According to state business records, Bernardo and former state Rep. Michael DiMassa, a West Haven Democrat, are members of Compass Investment Group LLC. DiMassa was arrested by FBI agents on Oct. 20 and charged with wire fraud.

Federal authorities said Compass Investment Group received more than $600,000 in federal COVID-19 relief funds from the city of West Haven for consulting, lobbying and legal services to its health department that were never provided.

DiMassa has resigned from the legislature, as well as from his position as an aide to the West Haven City Council. His lawyer has declined to comment on the allegations.

Bernardo is listed on West Haven’s website as a housing specialist for the city’s Community Development Administration. Federal investigators said he is on administrative leave from that job.

According to an arrest warrant prepared by an FBI agent, three deposits totaling more than $45,000 were made into Bernardo’s personal bank account via cash, as well as checks and wire transfers, from Compass’s bank accounts, with each deposit coming only days after Compass received payments from West Haven.

DiMassa’s arrest came a week after the city’s mayor raised concerns about possible fraudulent spending of the city’s share of federal pandemic funds, and prompted calls from legislative Republicans for greater state oversight of the huge sums of federal money being provided to municipalities.

Federal investigators said DiMassa wrote Compass checks to himself ranging from nearly $11,900 to $87,650. Authorities said he also made cash withdrawals from the company’s bank accounts ranging from $8,000 to $10,000, with some of them coming around the same time as cash “buy-ins” of gambling chips at Mohegan Sun Casino.

West Haven Mayor Nancy Rossi said in a statement Thursday that she is “sick to my stomach over this alleged theft.”

NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) — Tennessee business leaders unhappy with recent efforts by the Republican-led Legislature to unravel COVID-19 prevention requirements hope to convince lawmakers to revisit some changes when they reconvene in January.

Two prominent business groups say they are especially troubled by a provision empowering citizens to sue businesses they believe slighted them with coronavirus vaccination requirements, which the bill largely bans for companies and government entities.

So far, Republican lawmakers who spearheaded the bill have given a cool reception to the call to revisit it by the Tennessee Chamber of Commerce and Industry and the state’s National Federation of Independent Business chapter.

The dispute, while largely couched in delicate language, offers a rare glimpse at a public rift between groups that tend to be closely aligned. Republican leaders are usually eager to highlight their close ties to business and tout Tennessee as a low-tax, low-regulation haven for companies.

Those alliances were tested during the three-day special session, which ended after an hourslong October standoff. Lawmakers met behind closed doors after manufacturers including Ford Motor Co. — for whom lawmakers had just approved an economic development package for a massive new Tennessee electric vehicle and battery production project — opposed the bill’s change that would let most businesses implement mask requirements only in rare, dire public health scenarios.

In the dark of the night, Republicans relented and carved private businesses out of stringent mask restrictions. Still, the bill was unsavory enough that the chamber and NFIB opposed its final form. Nine House Republicans voted no, two chose not to vote and others weren’t around for the overnight finale.

Republican Gov. Bill Lee hasn’t said whether he’ll sign the measure, which lawmakers passed after calling themselves into session because he declined to do so. Leaders of the business groups said they have let the governor know their concerns but aren’t currently lobbying for a veto. Tennessee lawmakers can easily override vetoes, and Lee hasn’t vetoed anything in office.

Both business groups have expressed concerns about requirements under President Joe Biden’s administration for workers at larger employers to get a COVID vaccine by Jan. 4 or face rigorous COVID-19 testing, which a federal appeals court has paused for now amid legal challenges.

But the wide-spanning state bill would put Tennessee law in conflict with the federal policy, with businesses stuck in the middle facing the prospect of lawsuits.

Before the bill passed, NFIB Tennessee Director Jim Brown warned lawmakers their votes could affect their scorecards with the group. Brown told the AP that it was only one vote — albeit, a big one — and “a lot of good friends of ours in the Legislature felt they had to vote for this and they’re still going to score high.” However, the group also plans to consider sponsors of separate bills opposed by business when discussing endorsements and campaign contributions, Brown said.

Bradley Jackson, president of the Tennessee Chamber of Commerce and Industry, said it’s in Tennesseans’ best interest for lawmakers and business to get back on the same page.

“I would equate it to two really good friends that have gotten along on so many issues had a disagreement,” Jackson told the AP. “Hurtful things have been said, but we know how each other feels on this issue and fundamentally agree on the future of Tennessee on economic prosperity and working together to achieve that.”

Legislative leaders have defended their work. House Speaker Cameron Sexton “disagrees with the direction NFIB and Tennessee Chamber is requesting,” spokesperson Doug Kufner said. He also said there is “much discussion” about whether there’s a need to extend COVID-19 liability protections for businesses past July 2022.

Senate Speaker Randy McNally’s spokesperson, Adam Kleinheider, said McNally is open to hearing ideas to improve laws but is proud of the work done by lawmakers, adding that the two business groups “had ample opportunity to weigh in at any point in the process and chose to engage only in the later stages.” Republican Sen. Todd Gardenhire had similar criticism when he ridiculed the chamber of commerce as the “chamber of horrors” in a committee meeting.

Brown said his group is disappointed in the “outcome and the process,” saying it wasn’t transparent and it was rushed.

Jackson told the AP he didn’t know what lawmakers would include, and two weeks out from session, could only tell member businesses some issues that were likely to come up because he didn’t know the specifics.

Looking forward, Brown said civil fines would be preferable for businesses than facing private lawsuits.

Jackson said legislation next year could also seek to tighten up definitions of what constitutes an employer’s adverse action that triggers cause to sue, among other possible changes."

BELGRADE, Serbia (AP) — At the main hospital in Romania’s capital, the morgue ran out of space for the dead in recent days, and doctors in Bulgaria have suspended routine surgeries so they can tend to a surge in COVID-19 patients. In the Serbian capital, the graveyard now operates an extra day during the week in order to bury all the bodies arriving.

For two months now, a stubborn wave of virus infections has ripped mercilessly through several countries in Central and Eastern Europe, where vaccination rates are much lower than elsewhere on the continent. While medical workers pleaded for tough restrictions or even lockdowns, leaders let the virus rage unimpeded for weeks.

“I don’t believe in measures. I don’t believe in the same measures that existed before the vaccines,” Serbian Prime Minister Ana Brnabic said last month as the Balkan nation sustained some of its worst daily death tolls of the pandemic. “Why do we have vaccines then?”

A World Health Organization official declared earlier this month that Europe is again at the epicenter of the coronavirus pandemic. While several Western European countries are seeing spikes in infections , it is nations to the East that are driving fatalities. Romania, Bulgaria and the Balkan states recorded some of the highest per-capita death rates in the world in the first week of November, according to the WHO.

Experts say fumbled vaccination campaigns and underfunded and mismanaged health systems set the stage for the latest outbreaks, which gathered pace as leaders dithered. Some are acting now — but many doctors say it took too long and is still not enough.

Many governments in the region are facing elections soon, and that no doubt made them reluctant to force people to get vaccinated or impose unpopular lockdowns even in former Communist nations that once carried out mandatory inoculations without hesitation or where leaders were quick to introduce closures earlier in the pandemic.

But politicians’ failure to quickly heed the calls of the medical community has likely undermined an already weak trust in institutions in countries where corruption is widespread. Misinformation about vaccines has also found fertile ground amid the broader distrust of authority.

That has left countries stumbling through the latest surge with few protections. While nations around the world have struggled with resistance to vaccines, many in Central and Eastern Europe have particularly low rates for places where supply is not an issue. Bulgaria and Romania, both in the European Union, have fully vaccinated about 23% and 35% of their populations, respectively. Bosnia and Herzegovina has just 21% fully vaccinated.

Referring to Romania’s slow response, physician and health statistician Octavian Jurma described his country as a “textbook example” of the “tragic consequences produced by a political takeover of the pandemic response.”

Leaders finally introduced a curfew this month, requiring people who don’t have a COVID pass — which shows proof of vaccination, recovery from the illness or a negative test — to stay at home from 10 p.m. to 5 a.m. Infections have since dropped slightly, but hospitals remain overwhelmed.

At the main one in Bucharest, the bodies of those who died from COVID-19 lined a hallway in recent days because there was no room in the morgue. Part of a waiting room was transformed into an emergency ward, with the raising of a plastic sheet.

In Serbia, some hospitals are so swamped that they are only handling virus patients — leaving doctors to sue Brnabic, whose government faces elections in April.

“Since Brnabic said she doesn’t believe in measures, some 900 people have died,” Slavica Plavsic, a lung disease specialist, told N1 television on Oct. 21.

The prime minster has rejected that criticism, saying Thursday that she is proud of her government’s response.

Meanwhile, authorities at the graveyard in Belgrade say that now they have an average of 65 burials a day, compared with between 35 and 40 before the pandemic. Gravediggers now bury people on Sundays — which typically they didn’t — to handle the load.

In neighboring Hungary, few mitigating measures are in place. Like Serbia’s, Hungary’s government says it would prefer to rely on vaccinations. With nearly 60% of people fully vaccinated, the country is better placed than most in the region — but that still leaves a large swath of the population unprotected.

Hungary’s government earlier this month ordered mask-wearing on public transportation and allowed private employers to mandate vaccines for their staff.

But Gyula Kincses, chairman of the Hungarian Chamber of Doctors, said that that was “too little, too late” and recommended that masks be made mandatory in all indoor spaces.

In a recent radio interview, Prime Minister Viktor Orban, whose populist party faces election next spring, said that mandatory vaccinations would “be beyond the limits of what Hungarians will accept,” even while acknowledging the new restrictions could only slow, not stop, the virus’s spread.

Hospitals in Bulgaria, with its low vaccination rate, were forced to temporarily suspended all non-emergency surgeries so more doctors could treat the influx of COVID-19 patients.

“Politicians now think only about the elections, but there inevitably will be a lockdown, however in tragic circumstances,” Ivan Martinov, a leading cardiologist at Sofia’s main emergency hospital, told national radio. Parliamentary elections are being held Sunday.

Soaring infections appear to have been a wake-up call to some extent in Croatia, which saw unusually large lines of people waiting for vaccines in recent days.

Authorities said on Wednesday that more than 15,000 people received their first dose a day earlier — a significant jump after vaccinations all but halted in the Adriatic country of 4.2 million.

Croatia and neighboring Slovenia have also introduced COVID passes in recent weeks.

But medical organizations in Slovenia have warned that the Alpine country’s health system is still on the verge of collapse. They urgently appealed to people to do their best to avoid seeking urgent care in the coming months.

“There are traffic accidents, accidents at work, other infections,” gasped Bojana Baovic, head of Slovenia’s Medical Chamber. “This is an alarming situation that we can cope with through maximum solidarity.”

BOISE, Idaho (AP) — The state’s top business lobby group will oppose any attempts by the Legislature to impose restrictions on businesses requiring employees get COVID-19 vaccines, the group’s president said in a letter to lawmakers on Tuesday.

Idaho Association of Commerce & Industry President Alex LaBeau told lawmakers that such a law would put “tyrannical practices on the free market.”

The Legislature is scheduled to reconvene Monday, mainly to pass a law or laws to thwart President Joe Biden’s vaccine mandates. But potential laws aimed at preventing Idaho employers from requiring employees get the coronavirus vaccine are also likely to be introduced by far-right Republican lawmakers.

Most mainstream Republicans are wary of government getting between employers and employees, including Republican House Speaker Scott Bedke and Republican Senate President Pro Tem Chuck Winder. Both have said lawmakers will look at legislation that would allow the state to initiate legal action over federal vaccine mandates on private employers. The legislation would include $2 million for a potential legal battle.

But about a dozen potential laws are expected to be brought forward next week, Bedke has said, to see how much support they get. Those proposed laws are likely to include some from far-right lawmakers that would prevent Idaho employers from requiring employees get the COVID-19 vaccine. It’s not clear how they will do in the House and Senate if brought forward.

“As we hear about possible legislation from self-proclaimed ‘champions of liberty and limited government’ in support of guaranteed salaries and stripping the rights of entrepreneurs, we couldn’t stand by quietly as this thinly cloaked socialism gets wrapped up in a facade of freedom,” LaBeau wrote.

Republican Sen. Todd Lakey, a more moderate lawmaker, was one of six lawmakers who signed a letter last summer voicing opposition to health care providers requiring employees to be vaccinated or potentially fired.

“That was certainly a concern of mine when the hospitals and health care providers were talking about terminating people because of them not being vaccinated,” said Lakey, who is vaccinated. “I’m trying to find the right balance to not insert government into the private sector. My position is that I respect the individual’s choice.”

Idaho is already involved in two lawsuits against the Biden administration involving vaccine mandates for federal workers and another involving vaccine mandates for employers with more than 100 workers as set out by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration. Under that rule, workers who aren’t vaccinated by Jan. 4 would have to wear a mask and be tested weekly.

LaBeau noted the lawsuits to lawmakers.

“While we applaud Governor (Brad) Little for joining a multi-state lawsuit against President Biden’s gross overreach to infringe on private businesses’ rights to set the COVID-19 health standards they see fit, we are dismayed that the Idaho Legislature now seeks to convene to tell Idaho employers how to run their businesses,” he wrote.

He said lawmakers should wait until the lawsuits are decided before taking any action.

TOPEKA, Kan. (AP) — Influential Kansas business groups have strong misgivings about Republican proposals aimed at financially protecting workers refusing COVID-19 inoculations while vocal anti-mandate activists don’t think the measures go far enough.

A joint legislative committee on Friday endorsed a proposal to make it easier for workers to claim religious exemptions to COVID-19 vaccine mandates and another to provide unemployment benefits to workers who are fired for refusing to get vaccinated. Both are a response to vaccine mandates from President Joe Biden applying to more than 100 million workers.

Republican lawmakers have forced a Thanksgiving-week special session of the GOP-controlled Legislature to consider the two GOP proposals for resisting the mandates. Democratic Gov. Laura Kelly has expressed opposition to the Democratic president’s mandates but has not embraced specific proposals. Lawmakers are set to convene Nov. 22.

The proposals drew criticism from the Kansas Chamber of Commerce and the state chapter of the National Federation of Independent Business. They fear that the unemployment measure will prove costly, raising the state taxes on businesses that help finance the benefits. They said the other measure could force business owners to choose between facing federal fines for granting exemptions too easily or facing lawsuits from aggrieved employees who don’t get them.

“We didn’t ask to be here,” said chamber lobbyist Eric Stafford. “We ask that you not punish us.”

Senate President Ty Masterson, an Andover Republican, drafted the proposals after the committee heard two days of testimony from dozens of people, almost all of them strongly opposed to the mandates.

But the strongest vaccine-mandate critics were not pleased with Masterson’s proposals, viewing them as too weak.

Some want to also allow exemptions for people who have non-religious objections to COVID-19 vaccines, while others want to prohibit private employers from imposing mandates.

“The draft bills we are being asked to comment on today, while a step in the right direction, don’t go far enough to end the madness,” said Gary Morgan, a resident of the Kansas City suburb of Shawnee.

Masterson shrugged off the criticism during a break in the committee’s meeting. He serves on the panel.

“You know what? Good legislation doesn’t make anybody happy,” he said.

Support for a special legislative session among Republicans grew quickly this week after Masterson outlined his proposals Tuesday. The Kansas Constitution required Kelly to call a special session if two-thirds of both chambers demanded one by petition and with that condition met, Kelly issued a the call Friday evening. The full Legislature has been out of session since May and wasn’t set to reconvene until January.

A third proposal on vaccine mandates emerged Friday from Democratic Rep. Vic Miller, of Topeka, but it’s not yet clear whether Republican leaders will allow it to be considered during the special session. It would allow workers to sue their employers if those employers imposed COVID-19 vaccine mandates separate from the federal mandates and the workers were harmed by the shots.

“It is possible for employers to do it on their own, independent of the feds,” Miller said. “When you cause injury, you should be responsible.”

Some mandate critics are generally are anti-vaccine, and some have repeated widespread misinformation about COVID-19 vaccines.

A few critics have compared Biden’s mandates to the Holocaust that killed millions of Jews during World War II, despite sharp criticism. That happened again Friday, when Kansas City, Kansas, resident Daran Duffy and two members of his family wore large yellow Stars of David on their chests, a reference to the stars Jews were forced to wear in Germany under the Nazis.

State Sen. Pat Pettey, a Kansas City Democrat, objected so strongly that the committee’s GOP chairwoman gaveled her down.

“You are not respecting Jewish people,” she told Duffy. “You are desecrating that memory.”

Masterson later tweeted that GOP senators rejected such analogies “in the strongest possible terms,” adding, “Such comparisons are inappropriate and bear no resemblance to the issues we are debating today.”

Pfizer asked U.S. regulators Tuesday to allow boosters of its COVID-19 vaccine for anyone 18 or older, a step that comes amid concern about increased spread of the coronavirus with holiday travel and gatherings.

Older Americans and other groups particularly vulnerable to the virus have had access to a third dose of the Pfizer and BioNTech vaccine since September. But the Food and Drug Administration has said it would move quickly to expand boosters to younger ages if warranted.

Pfizer is submitting early results of a booster study in 10,000 people to make its case that it’s time to further expand the booster campaign.

While all three vaccines used in the U.S. continue to offer strong protection against severe COVID-19 illness and death, the shots’ effectiveness against milder infection can wane over time.

Pfizer’s new study concluded a booster could restore protection against symptomatic infection to about 95%, even as the extra-contagious delta variant was surging. Side effects were similar to those seen with the company’s first two shots.

A median of 11 months after their last Pfizer vaccination, trial participants were given either a third dose or a dummy shot. Researchers tracked any infections that occurred at least a week later, and so far have counted five cases of symptomatic COVID-19 among booster recipients compared to 109 cases among people who got dummy shots.

The Biden administration had originally envisioned boosters for all adults, but faced a stinging setback in September when the FDA’s scientific advisers rejected extra Pfizer doses for everyone. The panel wasn’t convinced that young healthy people needed another dose, particularly when most of the world’s population remains unvaccinated, and instead recommended boosters just for certain groups — one of a series of decisions about extra doses for all of the three vaccines used in the U.S.

The current rules: People who initially received Pfizer or Moderna vaccinations are eligible for a booster six months later if they’re 65 or older, or are at high risk of COVID-19 because of health problems or their job or living conditions. Because the single-dose Johnson & Johnson vaccine hasn’t proven as effective as its two-dose competitors, any J&J recipient can get a booster at least two months later.

Also, anyone eligible for a booster doesn’t have to stick with their initial vaccination type and can get a different company’s vaccine, what’s called mixing and matching.

About 194 million Americans are fully vaccinated. Under today’s policies, authorities already estimated about 2 of every 3 vaccinated adults could qualify for a booster within the next few months. Many who don’t meet the criteria often score an extra shot because many vaccine providers don’t check qualifications.

FDA spokeswoman Alison Hunt said the agency would review Pfizer’s application “as expeditiously as possible,” but would not set a timeline for a decision. She also said the FDA hasn’t yet decided whether to convene its panel of outside experts to vet the data.

If the FDA authorizes Pfizer’s request for expanded boosters, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention then will make recommendations for how to use them.

Globally, boosters also are a hodge-podge. Some countries restrict them to older or medically fragile people while others have few restrictions. Israel, for example, has allowed Pfizer boosters for anyone 12 and older. Canada’s health regulator on Tuesday authorized Pfizer boosters for people 18 and older.

LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) — Republican state officials reacted with swift rebukes Thursday to President Joe Biden’s newly detailed mandate for private employers to require workers to be vaccinated against COVID-19, threatening a wave of lawsuits and other actions to thwart a requirement they see as a stark example of government overreach.

At least two conservative groups moved quickly to file lawsuits against the workplace safety mandate, and a growing roster of GOP governors and attorneys general said more lawsuits were on the way as soon as Friday. Some Republican-led states had already passed laws or executive orders intended to protect employers that may not want to comply.

“This rule is garbage,” South Carolina Attorney General Alan Wilson, a Republican, said Thursday through a spokesperson. “It’s unconstitutional and we will fight it.” His state’s governor, Republican Henry McMaster, said he is planning to issue an executive order keeping state agencies from enforcing the rule.

States have been preparing for the requirement since Biden previewed it in September. The Occupational Safety and Health Administration requirements released Thursday call for companies with 100 or more employees to be vaccinated by Jan. 4 or be tested weekly. Failure to comply could result in penalties of nearly $14,000 per violation. Federal officials also left open the possibility of expanding the mandate to smaller employers.

The White House said the administration has the authority to take actions designed to protect workers and expects the rule to withstand legal challenges.

Republican governors or attorneys general in Alabama, Arizona, Arkansas, Florida, Idaho, Indiana, Iowa, Louisiana, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, New Hampshire, Oklahoma and South Dakota said Thursday they would file lawsuits against the mandate. The Daily Wire, a conservative media company, filed a challenge in federal court on Thursday. So did companies in Michigan and Ohio represented by a conservative advocacy law firm.

Robert Alt, a lawyer representing the Midwest companies suing— manufacturer Phillips Manufacturing & Tower Company and packaging firm Sixarp — said both companies are already facing staffing shortages amid the pandemic. The mandate will make things worse, he said.

“It adds insult to injury and forces them potentially to fire trained employees,” said Alt, president and CEO of The Buckeye Institute, a conservative advocacy group.

States say they are focusing on the role of the federal government in the lawsuits they’re preparing.

“While I agree that the vaccine is the tool that will best protect against COVID-19, this federal government approach is unprecedented and will bring about harmful, unintended consequences in the supply chain and the workforce,” Indiana Gov. Eric Holcomb said in a statement.

At a news conference, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis criticized what he called an “executive fiat” for the private sector. Iowa Gov. Kim Reynolds characterized the mandate as an imposition on personal choice, saying people should be able to make their own health care decisions. She recently signed a bill guaranteeing that people who are fired for refusing a vaccine can qualify for unemployment benefits.

At least 19 Republican-led states previously sued the Biden administration over a separate mandate requiring vaccines for employees who work for federal contractors. Several more filed similar lawsuits Thursday.

Biden, in a statement Thursday, dismissed the argument from many GOP governors and lawmakers that a mandate for employers will hurt businesses’ ability to keep workers on the job.

“There have been no ‘mass firings’ and worker shortages because of vaccination requirements,” he said. “Despite what some predicted and falsely assert, vaccination requirements have broad public support.”

The administration has been encouraging widespread vaccinations as the quickest way out of the pandemic. A White House spokeswoman, Karine Jean-Pierre, said during a briefing Thursday that the mandate was intended to halt the spread of a disease that has claimed more than 750,000 lives in the U.S.

“So you know, the question that we always have and that we ask to the Republicans is, why are they getting in the way?” Jean-Pierre said. “Why are they getting in the way of trying to protect and save lives? That’s all we’re trying to do.”

Challenges to the workplace mandate from Republicans and conservative groups are expected to be broad-based and quick, reflecting yet another aspect of the COVID-19 response — from mask requirements to social-distancing guidelines — that has fallen into a partisan divide. Democratic governors and attorneys general were relatively quiet after the OSHA rules were announced on Thursday. From California, Gov. Gavin Newsom issued a simple Twitter message: “The right move.” Another Democrat, North Carolina Attorney General Josh Stein, defended mandates in an emailed statement to The Associated Press.

Laura Kelly, the Democratic governor in Republican-dominated Kansas, was trying to walk a fine line on the new workplace rules. She said after a chamber of commerce event Thursday that federal mandates “tend not to work” and that she wanted a “Kansas-focused” way to meet, them but did not give details.

All 26 Republican state attorneys general have previously said they would fight the requirements, and most of them signed a letter to Biden saying as much.

Key to their objection is whether OSHA has the legal authority to require vaccines or virus testing.

In the letter to Biden, the top state government lawyers argued that the agency can regulate only health risks that are specific to jobs — not ones that are in the world generally. Seema Nanda, the top legal official for the U.S. Department of Labor, which includes OSHA, says established legal precedent allows rules that keep workplaces safe and that those rules pre-empt state laws.

That hasn’t stopped state lawmakers and governors for taking a variety of actions aimed at undercutting federal mandates.

Texas Gov. Greg Abbott last month issued an executive order prohibiting private companies or any other entity from requiring vaccines. An Ohio lawmaker has proposed a bill barring schools and colleges from expelling students who refuse vaccines and preventing employers from firing workers who do so.

Arkansas has adopted a law creating a vaccine-mandate exemption for workers who can prove they have COVID-19 antibodies, although a broader measure banning employers from asking about vaccination status failed in the Legislature. The OSHA rule does include a religious exemption, as well as one for people who work exclusively outdoors or away from others — such as from home.

Lawmakers or governors in states including Kansas, South Dakota and Wyoming have called for special legislative sessions to counter vaccine mandates. In Nebraska, not enough state lawmakers agreed to a special session to get one on the calendar, but Gov. Pete Ricketts, a Republican in a GOP-dominated state, has been pushing them to keep trying.

In Ohio, factory owner Ross McGregor said he will follow the rules as he would any federal workplace mandate, but not because he agrees with them. McGregor, who said he is vaccinated, is opposed to the new requirement, just as he has publicly opposed efforts by Ohio Republican lawmakers to prevent him from mandating the coronavirus vaccine for his workers.

“At the end of the day, every employer, and every employment situation, dictates what is best,” said McGregor, a former Republican state lawmaker and owner of axle and brake component manufacturer Pentaflex, where he estimates that about half the 115 or so employees are vaccinated. “Having either a ban on mandates or an imposition of mandates goes against that”

With the approval of the COVID-19 vaccine for younger children, many elementary schools around the U.S. are preparing to offer the shots, which educators see as key to keeping students learning in person and making the classroom experience closer to what it once was.

Some district leaders say offering vaccine clinics on campus, with the involvement of trusted school staff, is key to improving access and helping overcome hesitancy — particularly in communities with low overall vaccination rates.

Still, many school systems are choosing not to offer elementary schools as hosts for vaccination sites after some middle and high schools that offered shots received pushback.

More than 250 families signed up for vaccinations that began Thursday at elementary schools in Duluth, Minnesota, which organized clinics immediately after the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention gave the final signoff to Pfizer’s kid-size COVID-19 shot for children ages 5 to 11. Superintendent John Magas called the vaccines a “game changer.”

“This brings us one step closer to moving from pandemic to endemic,” Magas said. “It allows us to reconsider things like social distancing and masking and things like that as safety permits.”

The Biden administration plans to send a letter to U.S. elementary schools in the next week asking them to host clinics. The Education Department is also urging schools to host town halls and webinars at which parents can talk to doctors about the vaccine.

Districts that have held or are planning clinics for younger children span Alaska to Vermont, said Hayley Meadvin, an Education Department senior adviser. Where schools choose not to host clinics, families can turn to doctor’s offices, hospitals and other sites.

“There are many points of access, and there’s no wrong door, honestly,” Meadvin said.

In Ohio, some school districts offered on-site clinics for older students, but Rick Lewis, director of the Ohio School Boards Association, said they haven’t heard from any districts planning them for younger students. He noted the CDC encourages districts to consider factors like local needs for school clinics and adequate community support.

School vaccine drives have faced pushback and protests in Ohio and elsewhere, and some opponents say they plan to keep up pressure as the focus of the vaccination effort shifts to younger students.

Sarah Kenney, who represents the group Mainers for Health and Parental Rights, argues that schools should not be getting involved or even talking to young children about the vaccine. She worries about its newness and potential for long-term side effects.

A Pfizer study of 2,268 children found the vaccine was almost 91% effective at preventing symptomatic COVID-19 infections. The FDA examined 3,100 vaccinated kids in concluding the shots are safe.

Kenney also expressed concern about stigma against children who do not get vaccinated.

“These conversations and personal decisions have been difficult enough to navigate for adults, we shouldn’t be putting this on our kids,” she said.

Parents are required to give authorization for their children’s shots. The vaccines are typically administered before or after school in partnerships with local hospitals and government health officials.

Chicago Public Schools, the country’s third-largest district, canceled school Nov. 12 to give parents an opportunity to get their children vaccinated by a healthcare provider or at a school-based site.

In Portland, Oregon, vaccines will be offered in eight elementary schools starting next week in high poverty districts, where families are more likely to face barriers such as access to health care or transportation, Superintendent Guadalupe Guerrero said.

On the heels of California’s decision to make vaccines for children mandatory, Portland is among districts considering the same. A recent board of education meeting to discuss that possibility was disrupted by a group of protesters. For that reason, security will be present at the vaccine clinics, and their times and dates won’t be publicized outside the local community, said Courtney Westling, the district’s director of government relations.

“Schools are a trusted community hub,” she said. “Families, in general, feel very safe at these school sites. We’re also not asking for identification or insurance cards. We don’t want people to fear ICE showing up or something. We are just trying to get people vaccinated so we can get some of this behind us and get back to some semblance of normalcy.”

In Hartford, Connecticut, schools superintendent Leslie Torres-Rodriguez said the vaccination clinics it is planning along with local hospitals will include school nurses, trusted by families. Only a third of the district’s students 12 and older are vaccinated.

“We take an equity stance here and think about the access and removing any barriers that our families might have,” she said.

In nearby Tolland, Connecticut, school superintendent Walter Willett said his district also is teaming with health providers, including UConn Health, to offer vaccines at school sites to younger students. He said vaccines are important, not just for keeping kids in school, but for teachers, janitors and other staff who tend to be more at risk.

“They can more effectively do their job when kids aren’t bouncing in and out of the classroom in quarantine,” he said.

Liz Hamel, the vice president of opinion and survey research at KFF, a nonprofit that studies health care issues, said their recent surveys show parents are more likely to accept vaccine information from their pediatrician than from government or educational sources.

“And one thing we found with teens is that most parents didn’t want their school to require the vaccine, but if their school provided information or encouraged students to get vaccinated, those parents were more likely to say that their child was getting the vaccine,” she said.

Sam Valle, a 9-year-old in Old Saybrook, Connecticut, said he’s been bugging his parents for months, asking when he can get the vaccine.

“Right now, I can’t go into a restaurant without it,” he said. “I can’t go into a store without wearing a mask. I can’t do a lot of things.”

Sam’s quest will soon be over. His mother says his shot is now scheduled for Wednesday.

Tens of millions of Americans who work at companies with 100 or more employees will need to be fully vaccinated against COVID-19 by Jan. 4 or get tested for the virus weekly under government rules issued Thursday.

The new requirements are the Biden administration’s boldest move yet to persuade reluctant Americans to finally get a vaccine that has been widely available for months — or face financial consequences. If successful, administration officials believe it will go a long way toward ending a pandemic that has killed more than 750,000 Americans.

First previewed by President Joe Biden in September, the requirements will apply to about 84 million workers at medium and large businesses, although it is not clear how many of those employees are unvaccinated.

The Occupational Safety and Health Administration regulations will force the companies to require that unvaccinated workers test negative for COVID-19 at least once a week and wear a mask while in the workplace.

OSHA left open the possibility of expanding the requirement to smaller businesses. It asked for public comment on whether employers with fewer than 100 employees could handle vaccination or testing programs.

Tougher rules will apply to another 17 million people working in nursing homes, hospitals and other facilities that receive money from Medicare and Medicaid. Those workers will not have an option for testing — they will need to be vaccinated.

Workers will be able to ask for exemptions on medical or religious grounds.

The requirements will not apply to people who work at home or outdoors.

Biden framed the issue as a simple choice between getting more people vaccinated or prolonging the pandemic.

“While I would have much preferred that requirements not become necessary, too many people remain unvaccinated for us to get out of this pandemic for good,” he said Thursday in a statement.

Biden said his encouragement for businesses to impose mandates and his own previous requirements for the military and federal contractors have helped reduce the number of unvaccinated Americans over 12 from 100 million in late July to about 60 million now.

Those measures, he said, have not led to mass firings or worker shortages, adding that vaccines have been required before to fight other diseases.

OSHA said companies that fail to comply with the regulations could face penalties of nearly $14,000 per violation.

The agency will face enforcement challenges. Even counting help from states, OSHA has only 1,850 inspectors to oversee 130 million workers at 8 million workplaces. An administration official said the agency will respond to whistleblower complaints and make limited spot checks.

The release of the rules followed weeks of regulatory review and meetings with business groups, labor unions and others.

OSHA drafted the rules under emergency authority meant to protect workers from an imminent health hazard. The agency estimated that the vaccine mandate will save more than 6,500 worker lives and prevent more than 250,000 hospitalizations over the next six months.

The rules set up potential legal battles along partisan lines between states and the federal government. Several states and Republican governors threatened to sue, contending that the administration lacks the power to make such sweeping mandates under emergency authority.

OSHA’s parent agency, the Labor Department, says it is on sound legal footing. The department’s top legal official, Seema Nanda, said OSHA rules preempt conflicting state laws or orders, including those that bar employers from requiring vaccinations, testing or face masks.

Senate Republicans immediately launched a petition to force a vote to overturn the vaccine mandate, but with Democrats controlling the chamber, the effort is nearly certain to fail.

The rules will require workers to receive either two doses of the Pfizer or Moderna vaccines or one dose of the Johnson & Johnson vaccine by Jan. 4 or be tested weekly. Employees testing positive must be removed from the workplace.

Companies won’t be required to provide or pay for tests for unvaccinated workers, but they must give paid time off for employees to get the shots and sick leave to recover from side effects that prevent them from working. Requirements for masks and paid time off for shots take effect Dec. 5.

Employers covered by the requirements must verify their workers’ vaccination status by checking documents such as CDC vaccination cards, records from doctors or pharmacies, or even an employee’s own signed declaration.

The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services issued a separate rule requiring vaccination for workers in 76,000 health facilities and home health care providers that get funding from the government health programs. A senior administration official said several large private health care organizations imposed their own mandates and achieved high vaccination rates — 96% or higher — without widespread resignations.

A previously announced requirement for federal contractors to make sure workers are vaccinated was scheduled to take effect Dec. 8, but the administration delayed that measure until Jan. 4 to match the requirements on other large employers and health care providers. Already, more than a dozen states have sued to block the mandate on contractors.

For weeks, Biden has encouraged businesses not to wait for OSHA to act. He has touted businesses that announced their own vaccine requirements and urged others to follow their lead.

Administration officials say those efforts are paying off, with about 70% of adults fully vaccinated.

Workplace vaccine mandates have become more common recently, with hospitals, state and local governments and some major corporations requiring COVID-19 shots for employees. The mandates have led to overwhelming compliance — in some cases 99% of workers — although a small but vocal number have faced dismissal, filed lawsuits or sought exemptions.

United Airlines required 67,000 U.S. employees to get vaccinated or face termination. Only a couple hundred refused to do so, although about 2,000 are seeking exemptions.

In August, Tyson Foods told its 120,000 U.S. workers that they must be vaccinated by Nov. 1. On Thursday, the company said more than 96% of its workforce was vaccinated, including 60,500 people who got their shots after the August announcement.

Walmart, the nation’s largest private employer, said in late July it was requiring all workers at its headquarters in Bentonville, Arkansas, and managers who travel within the United States to be vaccinated by Oct. 4. The retailer stopped short of requiring shots for front-line workers, however.

However, some companies have expressed fear that some vaccine-hesitant workers might quit, leaving their workforces even thinner in an already-tight labor market.

Several corporate groups, including the Business Roundtable, endorsed the mandate. However, retail groups worried that the requirement could disrupt their operations during the critical Christmas shopping period. Retailers and others also said it could worsen supply chain disruptions.

The National Retail Federation suggested the new rules are not needed because the rolling average number of new daily cases in the U.S. has fallen by more than half since September.

“Nevertheless, the Biden administration has chosen to declare an ‘emergency’ and impose burdensome new requirements on retailers during the crucial holiday shopping season,” said David French, a senior vice president for the trade group.

The number of new infections in the U.S. is still falling from a summer surge caused by the highly contagious delta variant, but the rate of decline has slowed in recent weeks. The 7-day moving average is down 6% from two weeks ago, at more than 76,000 new cases and 1,200 deaths per day.

Cole Stevenson, a 34-year-old autoworker at the Ford Rouge truck plant in Dearborn, Michigan, said he remains uncomfortable with a vaccine that was developed just a year ago.

He intends to get weekly COVID-19 tests and says he won’t reconsider getting the vaccine even if the tests are a financial or logistical burden.

“It’s getting pretty disgusting how much the government thinks they can be involved in people’s lives,” he said. “If the whole thing is sort of cooling down and cases are lowering, then buzz off — don’t force it on people.”

The Biden administration framed its vaccine mandate for private employers in life-and-death terms Monday in a legal filing that sought to get the requirement back on track after it was halted by a federal court.

Its filing in response to a stay issued over the weekend by the New Orleans-based 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals said there is no reason to rush into a ruling on whether the halt should be made permanent because the vaccine mandate won’t take effect until Jan. 4. Stopping the mandate from taking effect will only prolong the COVID-19 pandemic and would “cost dozens or even hundreds of lives per day,” lawyers for the Justice and Labor departments said.

As of Sunday, the seven-day rolling average for daily new deaths in the U.S. was 1,151, but it’s not clear what role a future vaccine mandate for private businesses would play in reducing that figure.

The mandate would apply to private businesses with more than 100 workers. Employees who do not receive the shots by Jan. 4 would be required to wear a mask and be tested weekly for the coronavirus. Occupational Safety and Health Administration rules issued last week create exemptions for workers citing religious objections and for those who do not interact in-person with coworkers or customers, as well as those who work only outdoors.

More than two dozen Republican state attorneys general, businesses, religious groups and conservative associations sued on the grounds that the federal government does not have the right to make the regulation, partly because COVID-19 is not a workplace-specific danger.

The Biden administration lawyers argued the risks were greater without the mandate than with it: “Petitioners’ asserted injuries, by contrast, are speculative and remote and do not outweigh the interest in protecting employees from a dangerous virus while this case proceeds,” they wrote.

At least 27 states filed legal challenges in at least six federal appeals courts after OSHA released its rules last week. All the states have a Republican governor or attorney general.

Over the weekend, judges on the New Orleans-based federal court paused the rule from taking effect, saying it raises “grave statutory and constitutional issues” and told the federal government to explain why the stay should not be made permanent.

The federal government said in its court filings Monday that the cases should be consolidated and that one of the circuit courts where a legal challenge has been filed should be chosen at random on Nov. 16 to hear it.

Administration lawyers said there is no reason to keep the vaccine mandate on hold while the court where the cases ultimately land remains undetermined. Besides, they argued, no employee will have to get a shot to comply until early December.

White House spokeswoman Karine Jean-Pierre expressed confidence that the COVID-19 vaccine mandate can withstand the legal challenges.

“This is an authority that we believe the Department of Labor has,” Jean-Pierre told told reporters during a news briefing. “We are very confident about it.”

Jean-Pierre said the mandate was about keeping people safe and that Congress had empowered the Labor Department to act with the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970. Vaccine mandates, including those for certain federal employees, contractors and the military, are a key component of the Biden administration’s strategy for containing a pandemic that has killed 755,000 people in the U.S.

It has said that widespread vaccinations are the quickest way out of the pandemic. But employers have pushed back, saying they fear the mandate would lead many of their workers to quit.

At a news conference Monday in Concord, New Hampshire, the president of Keller Companies, a manufacturer of building panels and plastics with 350 employees, described the OSHA rule as a “crushing blow to employers.”

Kathy Garfield, whose family has run the Manchester-based company for three generations, said it brought in a vaccination van to serve employees and gave workers paid time off to get the shots. Only about half have done so.

“We’ve had employees come forward and say if we mandate the vaccine, or this comes to be, they will not get the vaccine and they will not get tested. How can I run a business when I have no talent?” Garfield asked at a news conference with Gov. Chris Sununu, a Republican.

She also said it’s difficult to find a place to get the virus test. When they are available, they can cost $200.

“That’s the difference between eating and starving,” Garfield said. “So what are these employees going to do? They’re going to go to another employer with less than 100 employees.”

The administration announced plans for the workplace rule in September and unveiled the plans Nov. 4. Many Republican governors and state attorneys general signaled ahead of time that they would challenge it immediately, as they did with multiple federal lawsuits filed Friday.

The states filed in the most conservative appeals courts in the country, where appointees of former President Donald Trump bolstered Republican-appointed majorities. It was not entirely clear whether the emergency stay issued Saturday by the 5th Circuit applied nationwide or just to the states that filed in that case — Louisiana, Mississippi, South Carolina, Texas and Utah.

The 5th Circuit order read, “the Mandate is hereby stayed pending further action by this court” but did not specifically state whether it applied only to the five states. Louisiana Attorney General Jeff Landry said it applied nationally, but states that filed in different courts asked Monday for clarification.

“Though the Fifth Circuit’s order may be construed to have nationwide effect, it does not make an explicit statement on this point,” according to a state filing in the St. Louis-based 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. “To avoid any confusion and to secure full protection of their rights, Petitioners respectfully request that this Court enter a similar order here.”

Alabama, Florida and Georgia also asked for a stay Monday in the Atlanta-based 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, noting the one granted in the New Orleans-based court is temporary. The group of states, businesses and organizations challenging the rule in the St. Louis-based court called for a quick review of their challenge to the workplace rule.

“Thousands of employers and millions of working families will feel its impact immediately. The Court should act swiftly to forestall these illegal and unconstitutional injuries,” the groups said in court papers.

NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) — Smokey Bear taught kids the importance of preventing wildfires. McGruff the Crime Dog warned them not to talk to strangers. And in 1972, Big Bird lined up on “Sesame Street” to receive a measles vaccine as part of a campaign to get more youngsters inoculated against the disease.

But when that same iconic, 8-foot-tall children’s character tweeted last weekend that he had been vaccinated against COVID-19, conservative politicians immediately pushed back.

Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, a Republican, grilled Big Bird for what he called “government propaganda.” Fox News contributor Lisa Boothe described it as “brainwashing children” and “twisted.”

“My wing is feeling a little sore, but it’ll give my body an extra protective boost that keeps me and others healthy,” Big Bird tweeted.

“Sesame Street” has long faced grumbles from conservatives unhappy with its connections to U.S. public broadcasting, which receives federal funding. Yet this latest fallout marked a new contentious flashpoint that has plagued previous rollouts of the vaccine, just as the shot becomes available to children between the ages of 5 and 11.

Nearly 50 years ago, when the show was in its third season, “Sesame Street” encouraged kids to get the measles vaccine by showing Big Bird and other children getting the injection. The move was similar to other public service campaigns that used beloved characters to help teach children life lessons, including discouraging littering, wearing seatbelts and looking both ways before crossing the street.

“What Big Bird is doing is part of a long tradition. But what’s different now, of course, is that everything is political and everything is contentious,” said Thomas Doherty, an American studies professor at Brandeis University. “Something that we all wanted a year ago, the vaccine, is now this matter of great contention.”

Controversy at the intersection of TV and politics has popped up here and there for decades. In 1952, “I Love Lucy” didn’t use the word pregnant once in an episode that focused on the title character, Lucy Ricardo, having a baby after executives determined that doing so would be too scandalous.

The 1970s TV series “Maude,” a spinoff show of “All in the Family,” which explored all manner of political and racial issues in the household of a bigoted man from the New York City borough of Queens, showed the character Maude opting to get an abortion. The storyline was aired a year before the U.S. Supreme Court made Roe vs. Wade the law of the land. Multiple affiliates refused to air reruns of the episode.

In the early 1990s, the sitcom “Murphy Brown” found itself in a high-profile tiff during the 1992 presidential campaign when Dan Quayle, vice president to George H.W. Bush, lambasted the unmarried Murphy’s pregnancy as a mockery of fatherhood and American morality.

In “The Puppy Episode” of “Ellen” that aired in 1997, Ellen DeGeneres made history as the first prime-time lead on network TV to come out as gay. It was a huge cultural moment, but it also sparked attacks from religious groups. ABC later placed a warning about “adult content” when DeGeneres’ character kissed another woman in a separate episode.

Nearly 15 years ago, PBS was denounced by the nation’s education secretary after it spent money on a cartoon with lesbian characters. The episode of “Postcards From Buster” featured two lesbian couples while the title character, an animated bunny, was on a trip to Vermont — a state at the time that was known for recognizing same-sex civil unions when many others did not. PBS later decided not to distribute the episode to its stations.

“When you get a mass medium as dominant and powerful as television ... that’s always going to be a battleground over what messages get out there,” said Robert Thompson, director of the Bleier Center for Television and Popular Culture at Syracuse University.

Big Bird’s tweet ruffled others’ feathers at a time when educational messages directed toward children are under increased scrutiny. Schools have seen an uptick in heated debates from frustrated parents and elected officials over how racial and social justice issues are handled in classrooms and instructional materials. Most recently, Republican Glenn Youngkin won the Virginia governor’s race after seizing on conservatives’ frustrations with schools.

Meanwhile, education officials have faced multiple conflicts on how they should handle mask and testing requirements during a pandemic. Some Republicans have pushed back against marketing the COVID-19 vaccine directly to minors.

“The whole `Sesame Street’ embrace of diversity, inclusion, being nice, paying attention to people of poverty and of different colors, that is all a form of education directed at kids that most people would think is a really good thing and a great contribution. Then comes the vaccines,” Thompson said. “And now, this idea of getting a vaccine is no longer a celebration. It’s become something else.”

In Tennessee, the state briefly halted its vaccine outreach to children and fired its top vaccination director after GOP leaders threatened to dissolve the health agency over marketing efforts to get children vaccinated against the disease. During a meeting with department heads, Republican Rep. Scott Cepicky held up a printout of the ad featuring a smiling teen with a Band-Aid who had recently been vaccinated and called it “reprehensible.”

The GOP-controlled General Assembly later passed legislation banning certain minors as young as 14 from getting the shot without parental consent — an option that was previously available, albeit used infrequently. The measure, which Republican Gov. Bill Lee promised to sign this week, has only a handful of exceptions.

“It’s not surprising that the pandemic, vaccination and following public health advice might fall into this cultural battle or effort to leverage emotive issues to your political advantage if you’re a senator or a political candidate,” said Colin Woodard, author of “ American Character: The History of the Epic Struggle Between Individual Liberty and the Common Good .”

“The flashpoints in our culture wars,” Woodard said, “are often flashpoints between an individual liberty and a common good perspective.”

Hugs with friends. Birthday parties indoors. Pillow fights. Schoolchildren who got their first COVID-19 shots Wednesday said these are the pleasures they look forward to as the U.S. enters a major new phase in fighting the pandemic.

Health officials hailed shots for kids ages 5 to 11 as a major breakthrough after more than 18 months of illness, hospitalizations, deaths and disrupted education.

Kid-sized doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine cleared two final hurdles Tuesday — a recommendation from CDC advisers, followed by a green light from Dr. Rochelle Walensky, director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

At a Decatur, Georgia, pediatrician’s office, 10-year-old Mackenzie Olson took off her black leather jacket and rolled up her sleeve as her mother looked on.

“I see my friends but not the way I want to. I want to hug them, play games with them that we don’t normally get to,” and have a pillow fight with her best friend, Mackenzie said after getting her shot at the Children’s Medical Group site.

With the federal government promising enough vaccine to protect the nation’s 28 million kids in this age group, pediatricians’ offices and hospitals began inoculating children. Schools, pharmacies and other locations plan to follow suit in the days ahead.

The atmosphere surrounding the launch of shots for elementary-age students was festive in many locations. California vaccine sites welcomed children with inflatable animals and handed out coloring books and prizes. Vehicles lined up before dawn at an Atlanta site.

Many pediatricians’ offices expected strong interest in the shots at least initially, but health officials are worried about demand tapering off. Almost two-thirds of parents recently polled by the Kaiser Family Foundation said they would wait or not seek out vaccines for their kids.

Brian Giglio, 40, of Alexandria, Virginia, brought his 8-year-old son, Carter, in for vaccination at Children’s National Hospital in Washington, where kids with underlying conditions got first dibs. Carter has Type 1 diabetes that puts him at risk for complications if he were to become infected.

Giglio said the vaccine was “like a hallway pass for us to begin living life again.” And Carter said he can’t wait to leave masks behind once he’s fully vaccinated, so he can smell the things he used to be able to smell without it.

“I’m ready to trash it,” he said, though the CDC still recommends masks in schools and indoor public spaces where virus activity is high, even for the fully vaccinated.

Cate Zeigler-Amon, 10, was first in line Wednesday for a drive-through vaccination at Viral Solutions in Atlanta. The girl enthusiastically bounced around the car before the shot, which she broadcast live on her computer during morning announcements at her elementary school.

Afterward, Cate said she was looking forward to hugging her friends and celebrating her birthday indoors next month “instead of having a freezing cold outside birthday party.”

Hartford Hospital in Connecticut vaccinated seven youngsters Tuesday night, minutes after the CDC’s director gave the OK, and three more early Wednesday. As they got their shots, one girl squeezed her eyes shut and a boy barely flinched, and other waiting kids applauded.

The vaccine — one-third the dose given to older children and adults and administered with kid-sized needles — requires two doses three weeks apart, plus two more weeks for full protection. That means children who get vaccinated before Thanksgiving will be covered by Christmas.

“The timing before winter holidays is very fortunate,” said Dr. Jennifer Shu, whose Children’s Medical Group office in Decatur, Georgia, began vaccinating first thing Wednesday. “This age group will be able to spend holidays with friends and family more safely than they have been able to since the start of the pandemic.”

Thousands of pediatricians pre-ordered doses, and Pfizer began shipments soon after the Food and Drug Administration’s decision Friday to authorize emergency use. Pfizer said it expects to make 19,000 shipments totaling about 11 million doses in the coming days, and millions more will be available to order on a weekly basis.

Authorities said they expect a smooth rollout, unlike the chaos that plagued the national one for adults nearly a year ago.

Asked about parents having trouble finding vaccine appointments, White House coronavirus coordinator Jeff Zients said the vaccines.gov website will be updated by Friday for parents to search for locations near them. He said the kid vaccination campaign will be at full speed next week as Pfizer continues to ship millions more doses to locations around the country.

More than 6,000 vaccination clinics are being planned at schools around the country before the winter holiday break, he said.

Walgreens planned to start kids’ vaccinations Saturday and said parents could sign up online or by calling 1-800-Walgreens. CVS was also accepting appointments online and by phone at select pharmacies starting Sunday.

Despite the initial enthusiasm, not everyone is rushing out to get shots.

Hannah Hause, a Colorado mother of four children ages 2, 5, 7 and 8, is herself vaccinated, but wants to see how the child vaccines play out and are studied in the larger childhood population.

“It’s not studied long-term. It just makes me nervous,” she said. “As long as I can wait, I will wait.”

At a White House briefing Wednesday, Walensky said authorities thoroughly reviewed all available data on the vaccine’s safety, efficacy and the immune response it generates before recommending shots for kids.

Dr. Ada Stewart, a Black family physician in Columbia, South Carolina, and past president of the American Academy of Family Physicians, said she’s seen the toll the virus has taken on younger children — not just in family illness and death but with school disruptions, slipping grades and mental strain.

School closures throughout the pandemic have disproportionately burdened children of color, widening academic gaps and worsening mental health, according to data presented Tuesday to CDC advisers. It showed more than 2,000 COVID-related school closures in just the first two months of the current school year.

A Pfizer study of 2,268 children found the vaccine was almost 91% effective at preventing symptomatic COVID-19 infections. The FDA examined 3,100 vaccinated kids in concluding the shots are safe.

Some skeptics have questioned the need for kids to get vaccinated since they are less likely than adults to develop severe COVID-19. But with the delta variant, they get infected and transmit “just as readily as adults do,” Dr. Anthony Fauci said at a recent White House briefing.

Infected kids have also contributed to the U.S. toll — almost 46 million infections and more than 740,000 deaths.

Since the pandemic began, at least 94 children ages 5 to 11 have died from COVID-19, more than 8,300 have been hospitalized and over 5,000 have developed a serious inflammatory condition linked to the coronavirus. Black and Latino youngsters and those with chronic conditions are among the hardest hit.

Full Coverage: Coronavirus vaccine

Kye’vontay Jordan, 7, who is Black, has diabetes and got his shot at Children’s National Hospital in Washington. The vaccine gave his dad peace of mind.

“Now I can sleep not worrying about him going to school,” said Brian Jordan. “Being exposed to the coronavirus could really affect him and mess him up.”

The Green Bay Packers were fined $300,000 and quarterback Aaron Rodgers and receiver Allen Lazard were fined $14,650 by the NFL for violating the league’s COVID-19 protocols.

Here’s an explanation of the NFL’s disciplinary procedures and guidelines in the COVID-19 protocols.

HOW IS THE PUNISHMENT FOR BREAKING COVID-19 PROTOCOLS DETERMINED?

The NFL, the NFL Players Association and their medical directors and independent infectious disease experts put together the protocols. The discipline for violating them was negotiated, with the league and union reaching agreement on specific fines for players. The NFL determines fines for franchises in violation of the protocols.

WHAT ARE THE PARAMETERS FOR DISCIPLINING PLAYERS?

They are broken down in several categories.

ADVERTISEMENT

For any player who fails or refuses to fully cooperate with an investigation led by the NFL and/or NFLPA regarding compliance: one week’s salary up to $50,000. And for refusal to submit to required virus testing: $50,000.

For refusal to wear a tracking device when required: $14,650.

An unvaccinated player gathering in any number for any reason with other players and/or members of the club’s staff at a time when the team is “shut down” due to a COVID-19 outbreak is a $50,000 fine.

For any player who is not fully vaccinated, the $14,650 fine applies to:

— Gathering outside of the club facility or team travel in groups of more than three players or other individuals.

— Engaging in in-person meetings, practices and/or training activities outside of club facilities with other players and/or staff.

— Attending an indoor nightclub (unless the player is wearing personal protective equipment and there are no more than 10 people in the club). Or attending an indoor bar (other than to pick up food, or unless the player is wearing PPE and there are no more than 10 people in the bar).

— House gatherings of more than 15 people without the player and all guests wearing masks or PPE, or where social distancing for the more than fifteen people is impossible.

— Attending an indoor music concert/entertainment event. And attending a professional sporting event (other than applicable NFL games or events; or unless the player is seated in a separate section, such as a suite or owner’s box, is wearing PPE and there are no more than 10 people in that separate section).

— Attending an event that is prohibited by state and/or local regulation or other executive orders or laws implemented due to COVID-19.

— Refusal to wear a mask or PPE; and/or maintain physical distancing in club facilities or during travel.

WHICH OF THESE DID RODGERS AND LAZARD VIOLATE?

ADVERTISEMENT

The NFL was not specific on that, but Rodgers had been seen without a mask at the Packers’ facility, particularly during news conferences.

Rodgers, who in August said he was “immunized” against COVID-19, said Tuesday: “I made some comments that people might have felt were misleading. To anybody who felt misled by those comments, I take full responsibility for those comments.”

Rodgers said Friday that he sought alternative treatments rather than the NFL-endorsed vaccinations because he is allergic to an ingredient in the Moderna and Pfizer vaccines. He didn’t specify the ingredient.

WHAT IF A PLAYER DOESN’T COOPERATE WITH A LEAGUE OR TEAM INVESTIGATION?

The NFL may impose discipline on such players or ones who knowingly provide misleading or incomplete information during a contact tracing interview. The maximum fine amount is for one week’s game check up to $50,000 for a first offense. But there could be subsequent discipline for further offenses.

CAN A PLAYER APPEAL ANY DISCIPLINARY ACTION?

Yes — based upon the absence of just cause; whether the player actually was engaged in such conduct; whether the punishment imposed by the NFL was warranted for that conduct; and a variety of other allowable bases.

Rodgers appealed the decision to not accept his treatments as equal to a vaccination but lost the appeal. He has not yet appealed Tuesday’s fine and has not indicated he will do so.

WHAT WOULD BE THE DISCIPLINE FOR REPEAT OFFENDERS?

Repeat violations would subject players to increased discipline, including for conduct detrimental to the game. A maximum fine of one week’s salary and/or suspension without pay for four weeks or less would be imposed.

WHY ARE TEAMS PUNISHED?

All 32 NFL teams are required to ensure a safe environment not only at their facilities but at stadiums and during travel. They also are required to monitor the actions of players and staff, which includes taking around-the-clock videos at their facilities.

Players also must inform the team if they are vaccinated, and those who are not must adhere to specific protocols for them. The NFL found that the Packers did not handle these situations properly.

COULD GREEN BAY LOSE DRAFT CHOICES FOR THESE VIOLATIONS?

Yes, but it is unlikely. After several teams were discovered to have violated protocols in 2020 — leading to COVID-19 outbreaks and, at times, schedule adjustments — only one, New Orleans, was stripped of a 2022 sixth-round pick.

More than a year and a half after COVID-19 concerns prompted the U.S. to close its borders to international travelers from countries including Brazil, China, India, South Africa, the United Kingdom and much of Europe, restrictions are shifting to focus on vaccine status.

Beginning Monday, bans on travel from specific countries are over . The U.S. will allow in international travelers, but they must be vaccinated — with a few exceptions.

The U.S. is also reopening the land borders with Canada and Mexico for vaccinated people. Most trips from Canada and Mexico to the U.S. are by land rather than air.

Here are some questions and answers about the changes:

WHY ARE THESE CHANGES HAPPENING?

The goal is to restore more normal travel while limiting the spread of COVID-19, the government says. The travel industry and European allies have pushed for an end to country-specific bans. Americans have been allowed to fly to Europe for months, and Europeans have been pushing the U.S. to change its policies.

In 2019, before the pandemic, about one-fifth of the roughly 79 million visitors to the U.S. came from Europe.

WHAT ARE THE MAIN REQUIREMENTS?

All adult foreign nationals traveling to the U.S. must be fully vaccinated before boarding their flight. Like before, travelers will still have to show proof of a negative COVID-19 test taken within 72 hours of departure to the U.S.

EVERYONE NEEDS TO BE VACCINATED?

Yes, with some exceptions. Children under 18 don’t need to be vaccinated but they do need to take a COVID test. Kids 2 and younger are exempt from testing requirements.

WHAT ABOUT ADULTS WHO AREN’T VACCINATED?

Since half the world remains unvaccinated, and vaccine distribution has been so skewed to rich countries, the Biden administration is leaving a loophole for people who live in countries where vaccines are scarce. That list includes about 50 countries where fewer than 10% of people have been vaccinated. Travelers from those countries will need permission from the U.S. government to come, and it can’t be just for tourism or business travel.

The U.S. government says it will permit unvaccinated international visitors to enter the country if there is a humanitarian or emergency reason, such as an emergency medical evacuation. Those exceptions will be applied “extremely narrowly” and require approval from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. There could also be a medical exception, with documentation from a doctor.

WHAT WILL AMERICANS HAVE TO DO?

ADVERTISEMENT

Americans who are unvaccinated have to show proof of a negative COVID-19 test within one day of international travel. If you’re vaccinated, you need to take a test within three days of your departure, for both Americans and citizens of other countries. This does not apply to flights within the U.S.

WHO IS GOING TO ENFORCE THE VACCINE RULES?

That’s up to airlines. They will have to verify vaccine records and match them against ID, and if they don’t, they could face fines of up to nearly $35,000 per violation. Airlines will also collect information about passengers for contact tracing efforts. There will be CDC workers spot-checking travelers for compliance in the U.S.

WHICH VACCINES WILL LET YOU IN?

Most but not all of them . Any COVID-19 vaccine approved for emergency use by the World Health Organization, which include the Pfizer, Moderna and Johnson & Johnson vaccines used in the U.S. as well as most used overseas, such as AstraZeneca and China’s Sinovac. Not currently allowed is Russia’s Sputnik V vaccine, which is authorized in 70 countries. The WHO is reviewing Sputnik but hasn’t approved it.

WHAT IF YOU DRIVE IN FROM MEXICO OR CANADA, OR TAKE A FERRY?

The land borders have only been open for “essential” travel. Now, anyone can come, if they’re vaccinated against COVID. Be prepared to show proof of the shot to Customs and Border Protection agents. Children are exempt from the requirement.

HOW WILL THIS AFFECT TRAVEL?

While the administration is characterizing this as a reopening, some people who were technically allowed to fly to the U.S. earlier in the pandemic are now blocked because of their vaccination status. Other roadblocks to normal travel resuming are big delays in issuing U.S. visas, which people in most countries need to visit the U.S. for business and tourism, and restrictions in other countries that make travel difficult.

Even though people coming from China will now be allowed into the U.S., for example, not many are expected to travel because of restrictions at home. Before the pandemic, Chinese tourists were a lucrative market for the U.S. travel industry.

Industry experts do expect a big influx in people flying from Europe, and hope that a broader recovery in travel follows as more people globally get vaccinated, U.S. visa processing speeds up, other countries lift their own restrictions and people feel less scared about getting COVID because of travel."

For Erin Tridle and her boyfriend, it was love at first sight. They met while the American was traveling in France in the summer of 2019. They said, “I love you,” on day two. “People tell us it’s like something from a movie,” she said.

When Tridle returned home to Los Angeles, they began a long-distance relationship, spending time together when they could. Then the pandemic hit, separating them indefinitely as countries locked down travel.

“The uncertainty of not knowing when we would be together again was one of the hardest things I’ve even been through,” Tridle said.

Travel restrictions that have upended lives will relax Monday, when new rules go into effect allowing air travel from previously restricted countries as long as the traveler has proof of vaccination and a negative COVID-19 test. Land travel will require proof of vaccination but no test.

Eirini Linardaki was already in Paris on Friday, making her way from her home in Crete to her partner of seven years in New York City on a series of four flights. The visual artist said the travel restrictions were especially hard on people in nontraditional relationships. But at 45, it’s not so easy for her to just move to America.

“I have kids and a career, and I also have him,” she said. “I love him, so I have to make it fit into the structure of my life.”

Loved ones have missed holidays, birthdays and funerals while nonessential air travel was barred from a long list of countries that includes most of Europe, Brazil and South Africa. Closures at the land crossings with Mexico and Canada have devastated the border towns where traveling back and forth, sometimes daily, is a way of life.

Before the border closure, Montreal junior college teacher Gina Granter and her partner in New York City saw each other at least twice a month. Now, between the closures, quarantine rules and other restrictions, they’ve managed to see each other only three times since the beginning of the pandemic.

When her partner finally was able to travel to see them after missing their daughter’s second birthday, the little girl didn’t remember him, Granter said.

“I have a brother named Steven, and she was calling her dad ‘other Steven’ or occasionally ‘Granddad,’” Granter said. “She had no memories of being with him in New York.”

With the reopening, Granter, 42, is looking forward to regular weekend visits again, and she plans a long trip to New York around Christmastime.

“There were anguished nights, and it was so hard,” she said.

For many, one of the most frustrating things about the travel restrictions has been their seemingly arbitrary nature, said Edward Alden, a senior fellow with the Council on Foreign Relations. The list of restricted countries doesn’t necessarily match the places with the worst COVID-19 outbreaks. And Alden sees no logic in restricting land travel but not air travel in North America.

ADVERTISEMENT

“There was a lot of public anger,” he said. “Many people were willing to accept restrictions, but not the lack of rationale and logic, particularly for couples and families separated for long periods.”

There were ways around the restrictions, but they were often difficult and expensive. For instance, the air travel ban didn’t restrict citizens of those countries, but rather travel from those countries.

For Bárbara Feitoza of Brazil, that meant staying for two weeks in Colombia, where she knew no one and didn’t speak the language, so she could travel to the U.S. to be with her boyfriend in March. It was her first international trip, and she said it was terrifying to fly at the height of the pandemic.

The 28-year-old civil engineer from outside of Rio de Janeiro was at work when she learned the U.S. was preparing to drop its travel restrictions. Feitoza said she was “euphoric,” jumping from her seat as bewildered colleagues looked on.

Some of those separated from loved ones found support in an online group called Love Is Not Tourism. Among them was Linardaki, who said she was impressed by the variety of people’s circumstances.

“It’s not only people in their 20s,” she said. “There were people who’ve known each other for very little time, people who’ve known each other for years, people who are 65 or 70 years old. People all over the world were united by this difficulty.”

As for Tridle and her boyfriend, they hope to get married in a couple of years and live in the same country. But for now, the 30-year-old is just looking forward to him being able to visit at Christmas.

“I’m super excited for him to come to the U.S. again so we can spend some good, quality time together here,” she said.

NEW YORK (AP) — Thanksgiving is Jonatan Mitchell’s favorite holiday, usually spent with his wife co-hosting up to 20 loved ones. He’d been looking forward to the gathering this year after calling it off in 2020 due to the pandemic, but one of the most pressing issues of the times got in the way: Who’s vaccinated and who’s not?

Mitchell, 35, in Coon Rapids, Minnesota, has a rare neurological disorder called Kleine-Levin Syndrome and a smattering of related health issues that leave him at high risk should he contract COVID. Two relatives — his father-in-law and a brother-in-law — won’t get vaccinated.

Rather than laying down an ultimatum doomed to fail, the Mitchells called off Thanksgiving, choosing instead to host a Friendsgiving the following day. Mitchell’s vaccinated wife will catch up with her family on Thursday.

The situation, which Mitchell said is upsetting and frustrating, resonates with many families navigating the vaccination divide for the holidays. Thanksgiving is a bellwether for how the rest of the season will go among those facing family conflict over the shot.

ADVERTISEMENT

“This is a line in the sand I’m willing to draw with others,” Mitchell said of the choice not to confront his unvaccinated relatives. “I’ve cut off a handful of friends and acquaintances that are staunchly anti-vaccine, but you can’t do that with family.”

That sentiment, echoed by others, points to a transition in the pandemic from abject fear over public safety to a more long-term and intimate reshaping of social norms, said Karla Erickson, a professor of sociology at Grinnell College.

“Families often kind of mute conflicts and, because we paused in a way that’s really rare for families, the restarting of ritual gives us a moment to reconsider things,” she said. “There will be new hesitancy. A lot of people who are vaccinated might not be willing to go to an event where the host hasn’t asked or doesn’t know.”

Carrie Verrocchio, 55, in Binghamton, New York, is a long-haul COVID survivor still struggling with a loss of taste and smell 10 months after testing positive. She’s hosting about 11 for Thanksgiving. Five are unvaccinated. All have been informed, she said.

“You just want people to be happy and be together, and it feels like there is constant friction. No matter what we do, there’s constant friction these days,” said Verrocchio, who took the vaccination after contracting the virus. “We’re handling it by letting everyone make their own decisions. It isn’t ideal, but it is a plan.”

Lizzie Post is the great-great-granddaughter of etiquette legend Emily Post. Her famous relative wrote her first book, “Etiquette,” in 1922, not long after the Spanish flu took its deadly toll. Emily made no mention of how to navigate such a threat in that first edition, but the subject today is hard for her etiquette standard bearers to ignore.

ADVERTISEMENT

“It’s a really delicate subject, and it’s not going to go well for everybody,” said Post, who is co-president of the Emily Post Institute, host of the Awesome Etiquette podcast, and author and co-author of several books on etiquette.

“A lot of us have gotten used to general entertaining since vaccinations have been in play. That means we actually have experience with it and we know where our standards are for ourselves. But there are some really good reasons to back off and say, you know, maybe the big family thing isn’t worth it if it’s going to be so fraught,” she said.

The avoidance of fraught is exactly the approach Eva Keller and her husband are taking for Thanksgiving. He has been vaccinated. She has contracted COVID twice and has no plans to get the shot. There was no talk of Thanksgiving with her husband’s kin.

“My husband’s family has made it clear that I’m not allowed inside any of their homes until I’m fully vaccinated,” said Keller, 27, in Anaheim, California. “My husband only got vaccinated because of his parents insisting. He was concerned his mother would worry herself to death if he didn’t.”

The two will spend Thanksgiving at home together.

Erickson sees other pandemic strands at play heading into the holiday season.

“There are also questions,” she said, “like how did this person or this family navigate the pandemic more generally? Do we share values about what this last year has meant for our families? Did we stay in touch? Have we reconnected enough to share the holiday?”

August Abbott answers etiquette questions at JustAnswer.com, a help line that has just over 10 million unique monthly visitors. Of late, she has been responding to a barrage of questions about holiday gatherings and vaccinations. Among them: Is it rude to ask for a guest’s vaccination status? Can I disinvite somebody who isn’t vaccinated?

“It’s kind of like Typhoid Mary. Do you invite her to dinner knowing she’s Typhoid Mary, or do you explain to Mary, `I’m sorry, we can’t take a chance. We love you, but we can’t take that chance.′ That’s what you’ve got to do with unvaccinated people when it comes to COVID, most especially if someone in your household is elderly or immunocompromised. This is just a matter of health and respecting each other, not political,” she said.

Tone, Abbott said, is everything.

“So it’s not unreasonable to say to Uncle Jack, you know, you haven’t been vaccinated. That’s your prerogative. I respect that. I love you. We can’t take the chance. So, Uncle Jack, do you want to come to this dinner via video? There are options like that, but you can’t jeopardize health to be polite,” she said.

Frederick Brushaber, 36, in Cincinnati will be gathering for Thanksgiving with 13 family members at his mother’s house in Knoxville, Tennessee. The group includes his husband and their 15-month-old son, Freddie, who has Down syndrome, which puts him at higher risk for complications should he catch COVID.

Brushaber’s 88-year-old grandmother, who lost her husband this year, was supposed to be driving from Florida to Knoxville with an aunt and uncle. They’re not vaccinated. They won’t be coming after his mother had the Thanksgiving vaccination talk with them. That means grandma must board a plane alone for the first time without her husband.

“I’m not thrilled about that but I’m just happy I get to be the winner of this,” he said. “I get to have grandma and Freddie be there and I won’t have to worry about anything. The numbers for people with Down syndrome are really bad. I just wish people knew that like, yeah, you have a choice to do things, but some of the most vulnerable people don’t have a choice.”

MISSION, Kan. (AP) — School board candidates opposing mask mandates and lessons about racism in U.S. history won in red states and some politically divided districts but often came up short in their bids to shape policy for school districts over the newest culture war issue.

The mixed results complicate the picture for Republicans who are increasingly looking to the education fight as a galvanizing issue that could help them sway voters. They point to the upset in Virginia by Republican Glenn Youngkin, who won his race for governor Tuesday in the liberal-leaning state after making education grievances a key part of his campaign . Some conservative political action groups said they racked up wins in the school board races where they funneled money.

ADVERTISEMENT

But across the country, culture and identity fights were less decisive. The political tracking website Ballotpedia identified 96 school districts in more than a dozen states where race education and masking were part of the debate. It found that at least one anti-critical race theory or anti-mask candidate prevailed in 35 of the 86 districts in which it has determined winners, or 40%.

“Where they won, they won in really high numbers,” said Doug Kronaizl, a staff writer for Ballotpedia, noting that candidates who won on the issue tended to be concentrated in the same districts. “But overall nationwide they didn’t win that much.”

In Connecticut, a slate of five candidates running in opposition to critical race theory lost the board of education race in the Guilford school system, an overwhelmingly white New Haven suburb of 22,000 where a petition calling for the superintendent’s removal circulated after the district ditched its Indians mascot and doubled down on efforts to address social justice and racism.

“I think that there continues to be a national discussion where the term critical race theory is used inaccurately if not insincerely to attack work that is being done in schools, and that was successful in a lot of races,” said Superintendent Paul Freeman, who said the district doesn’t teach critical race theory.

Technically, it is an academic framework that centers on the idea that racism is systemic in the nation’s institutions and that they function to maintain the dominance of white people. But in recent months, it has become a catch-all political buzzword for any teaching in schools about race and American history.

ADVERTISEMENT

“We do not shame or blame the white children in Guilford when we talk about the issues of race or racism in our classrooms, whether historic or contemporary,” Freeman stressed.

Incumbent school board members in Mequon, Wisconsin, a wealthy, Republican-leaning suburb north of Milwaukee, won decisively after a group of parents led a recall effort based largely on their opposition to the district’s hiring of a diversity consultant. All four incumbents were reelected by more than 1,000 votes after a summer-long petition drive that drew the attention of local Republicans.

In Springboro, Ohio, outside Dayton, Frank Catrine, a local Republican activist who is opposed to critical race theory, finished fifth out of eight candidates in a school board race in which all incumbents were reelected. He has argued that diversity and inclusion efforts exclude white students and parents.

“If you want true diversity, you’re open to everybody,” Catrine said. “But if they are only focused on Black people and the LGBTQ community, not everybody is welcome.”

In Washington state, school board candidate Riley Smith said that while knocking on doors in his Democratic-leaning district in Spokane this fall, he encountered very few people interested in discussing race in education.

“This whole critical race theory, anti-masking, that was dominating the national narrative wasn’t really on people’s minds,” said Riley, who beat a vocal opponent of the educational framework for the open seat.

Yael Levin, who leads the Virginia chapter of No Left Turn in Education, a group opposed to teaching critical race theory, said some losses were to be expected given the newness of the movement, which she said grew from the pandemic, when remote learning made parents more aware of what their children were being taught. The organization has ballooned to 78 chapters in more than 25 states since it was founded last year.

“This is a very new movement of parents. And it’s a direct result of COVID. So it makes sense that we succeeded in some places and didn’t in others,” Levin said, “but we’re going to keep our movement alive because the attack on our children is not stopping anytime soon.”

In conservative Wichita, Kansas, Ben Blankley was among three candidates voted out of office and replaced by a slate of anti-critical race theory candidates who have promised changes in COVID-19 mitigation efforts in the district.

“I kind of figured this would be the end result,” said Blankley, a 38-year-old aerospace engineer with a first-grader in the district. “Regardless of the decisions that we made, I figured there would be a political backlash eventually for a bunch of good people. And so it kind of steeled my resolve to make the best decisions I could with the information that we had knowing that being out of office could be an eventuality because of all of this.”

Across the state, mask mandate opponents were ahead Friday in several races in Johnson County, an increasingly purple Kansas City suburb that voted for Joe Biden for president in 2020 despite historically leaning Republican. Some of the winning candidates in the Blue Valley and Olathe districts got a boost from the 1776 Project PAC.

Axios reported the political action committee — named after former President Donald Trump’s now-disbanded 1776 Commission , which played down America’s role in slavery — was successful in three-fourths of 58 races in seven states. “Victories across the country and this is just the beginning,” the group tweeted .

Money from other conservative PACs flowed into the West Chester, Pennsylvania, race after board president Chris McCune antagonized critical race theory opponents. McCune, a Republican, initially was ahead in the vote count but has slipped behind a a PAC-backed critical race theory supporter and another candidate as mail-in ballots are counted.

“These allegations from the far right are very challenging and the climate around public education has been very toxic,” said McCune, 48, who works in software sales and whose five children all attend district schools.

1776 Action, which is separate from the similarly named political action committee, sent out mailers and targeted text messages in the West Chester race and another in Iowa. The group, which encourages candidates to sign a pledge calling for the restoration of “honest, patriotic education,” was encouraged by the results.

“This movement to defeat anti-American indoctrination in our schools is only going to grow stronger in 2022,” said Adam Waldeck, the group’s president.

TOPEKA, Kan. (AP) — Before her daughter’s birth, she spent weeks in bed. Another difficult pregnancy would be worse as she tried to care for her toddler.

Faced with that possibility, the 28-year-old Texas woman did what a growing number of people have considered: She had a friend in another state mail her the pills she needed to end her pregnancy. She took the pills, went to bed early and describes the experience as “calm” and “peaceful.”

“If people can have births at birthing centers or in their own homes, why shouldn’t people be able to have abortions in their own homes?” said the woman, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because she worries about legal reprisals as Texas moves to join several other states in disallowing mail delivery of abortion medications. “It’s a comfort thing.”

The COVID-19 pandemic and Texas’ near-ban on abortion fueled increased interest in obtaining abortion medications by mail. But with the legality in doubt in several states, some people looking to get around restrictions may not see it as worth the risk. The matter is taking on new urgency with the Supreme Court set to hear arguments next month in Mississippi’s bid to erode the Roe v. Wade decision guaranteeing the right to an abortion.

Some abortion-rights advocates worry that whatever state officials and anti-abortion groups promise, people ending their pregnancies at home will face criminal prosecutions.

“We don’t think that people are doing anything wrong to order medication from an online site,” said Elisa Wells, co-founder and co-director of Plan C, which provides information about medical abortions. “I mean, that’s how men get Viagra. They order it online, and nobody’s talking about that and asking, is that illegal?”

Medication abortions have increased in popularity since regulators started allowing them two decades ago and now account for roughly 40% of U.S. abortions. The medication can cost as little as $110 to get by mail, compared with at least $300 for a surgical abortion.

However, people seeking abortion pills often must navigate differing state laws, including bans on delivery of the drugs and on telemedicine consultations to discuss the medication with a health care provider. And until Democrat Joe Biden became president, U.S. government policy banned mail delivery nationwide.

ADVERTISEMENT

“We just didn’t want women to use these medications and not have any protections, any guidance, any consultation,” said Oklahoma state Sen. Julie Daniels, a Republican and lead sponsor of her state’s law banning delivery of abortion medication by mail, which is on hold amid a legal challenge.

Plan C saw roughly 135,000 hits on its website in September, about nine times the number it had before the Texas law that bans abortion as early as six weeks into a pregnancy took effect Sept. 1, Wells said.

Aid Access, which helps women get abortion pills and covers costs for those who can’t afford them, says it can’t yet provide data from recent months. It saw a 27% increase in the U.S. in people seeking abortion pills as states instituted restrictions early in the COVID-19 pandemic, according to a University of Texas study. The biggest increase was in Texas, which had limited access to clinics, saying it was necessary to check the coronavirus’ spread.

Aid Access has a physician based in Europe, Dr. Rebecca Gomperts, provide prescriptions to clients in 32 states that only allow doctors to do so. The pills are mailed from India.

“I don’t think that any state level regulation is going to stop Dr. Gomperts from what she’s doing,” said Christie Pitney, a California nurse-midwife who is Aid Access’ provider for that state and Massachusetts.

Indeed, Aid Access defied a 2019 order from the Food and Drug Administration to stop distributing medications in the U.S. In April, the Biden administration dropped the FDA ban on mail delivery of abortion medications during the pandemic.

The divide among Democratic-leaning and Republican-leaning states is stark in the St. Louis area. On the Illinois side, Planned Parenthood offers telemedicine consultations and prescriptions by mail. Missouri, however, bars telemedicine and requires a pre-abortion pelvic exam, which providers see as unnecessary and invasive.

“In Missouri, we don’t actually provide medication abortion because of the state requirement,” said Dr. Colleen McNicholas, chief medical officer of the regional affiliate.

Abortion opponents don’t expect the FDA restriction on abortion medication to be reinstated under Biden. GOP lawmakers in Arkansas,Arizona, Montana and Oklahoma already were working on new laws to ban mail delivery when the FDA acted. Texas’ mail-delivery ban takes effect Dec. 2. South Dakota GOP Gov. Kristi Noem issued an executive order in September.

Even some abortion opponents believe it will be difficult for states to crack down on providers and suppliers outside their borders, especially outside the U.S.

“Obviously it would be a lot easier if we had the cooperation of the federal government,” said John Seago, Texas Right to Life’s legislative director. “There’s no silver bullet yet identified of how we’re going to approach this kind of next frontier of the fight.”

Still, Seago says tough penalties give prosecutors an incentive to pursue violators. The Montana law, for example, mandates a 20-year prison term, a $50,000 fine, or both to anyone who mails pills to a state resident.

Pregnant people seek telemedicine consultations and abortion pills by mail because they don’t want to or can’t travel or can’t arrange time off or child care, abortion-rights advocates said.

“Just because somebody can’t access an abortion doesn’t mean that they’re going to all of a sudden want to continue a pregnancy that originally was not desired, right?” said Dr. Meera Shah, chief medical officer for the Planned Parenthood affiliate outside New York City, who also does abortions in Indiana.

A person in Ohio who identifies as nonbinary said they used an herbal remedy to self-manage an abortion alone in their college dorm room in 2016, before Aid Access launched its site, telling their roommate they had the stomach flu. They said they didn’t have a car and didn’t know they could get financial help, and called the Aid Access model “fantastic.”

“Any avenue to help pregnant people facilitate their own abortions and have that experience in whatever way best suits them is a great way to give bodily autonomy back to a wider range of patients,” they said, speaking on condition of anonymity because they fear harassment from anti-abortion protesters.

The new laws in Montana, Oklahoma and Texas say people can’t face criminal penalties for having medication abortions. Yet those provisions — and assurances from abortion foes that their goal is not to prosecute people who have ended pregnancies — don’t comfort some abortion-rights advocates.

They say roughly two dozen women have been prosecuted since 2000 in the aftermath of self-managed abortions. An Indiana woman who was sentenced to 20 years in prison for feticide in 2015 for a self-induced abortion spent more than a year behind bars before her conviction was overturned.

Some abortion-rights advocates said prosecutors also can use child endangerment or manslaughter charges against people who have had abortions — or who have had miscarriages that authorities deem suspicious. They worry that the poor and people of color are especially vulnerable.

“They can’t get drugs where they are, and so they may purchase pills from informal networks or online sites,” said Melissa Grant, chief operating officer of carafem, which operates clinics in four states and provides abortion medications in nine. “But that’s riskier in this country than actually taking the medicines.”

TRENTON, N.J. (AP) — A truck driver who ousted the powerful New Jersey Senate president in the election previously posted online calling Islam “a false religion,” comparing vaccine mandates to the Holocaust and defending rioters at the Capitol.

Republican Edward Durr apologized on Friday after media outlets highlighted the posts. His victory over Steve Sweeney , widely regarded as the second-most powerful Democrat in state government, in Tuesday’s election shocked the state’s political establishment. Durr spent a paltry sum on his campaign.

On Thursday and Friday, media reports highlighted posts Durr had made on Twitter and Facebook, including some critical of immigrants, boasting of defying state COVID-19 mask mandates, and making misogynist attacks on Democratic elected officials like then-Vice President-elect Kamala Harris.

Durr issued a statement Thursday night to radio station WHYY, and Friday to the website New Jersey Globe apologizing for the posts.

“I’m a passionate guy and I sometimes say things in the heat of the moment,” Durr said in identical comments to both outlets. “If I said things in the past that hurt anybody’s feelings, I sincerely apologize.”

Twitter showed Friday that Durr’s account had been deactivated by the user.

In a screenshot of a 2019 Twitter post captured by a WNYC reporter, Durr wrote, “Mohammed was a pedophile! Islam is a false religion! Only fools follow Muslim teachings! It is a cult of hate!”

“I support everybody’s right to worship in any manner they choose and to worship the God of their choice,” Durr said in his statement to the media outlets. “I support all people and I support everybody’s rights. That’s what I am here to do, work for the people and support their rights.”

Durr did not respond to phone and email messages from The Associated Press seeking comment Friday. A spokesperson for New Jersey Senate Republicans declined comment Friday, referring a reporter to Durr’s statement.

Also on Friday, the New Jersey chapter of the Council on American Islamic Relations called on Durr to meet with Muslim leaders and renounce hate.

In other posts, Durr seemed to equate not opposing COVID-19 vaccination mandates to remaining silent during the Holocaust, including with the post a photo of a yellow star that the National Socialist party forced Jewish people to wear.

He also said on Facebook that the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol was not an insurrection but “an unauthorized entry by undocumented federal employers.”

Durr’s Facebook posts show he closely followed and posted in support of former President Donald Trump’s baseless claims about election fraud. On Jan. 7, he wrote on Facebook, “I do not agree or support the entering of the Capitol! But I was not surprised after courts refuse to do their job!”

He also boasted last year of defying New Jersey’s indoor mask requirements while visiting stores, and appeared to downplay the seriousness of the pandemic.

Durr also used his Facebook account to highlight his campaign activities, posting photos of himself and others speaking with voters at their homes. He conveyed holiday wishes, posted about his dogs and wrote about his successes trying to eat more healthily.

Durr, a commercial truck driver, defeated Sweeney in southern New Jersey’s 3rd district, spending just $2,300 on his campaign. He was largely unknown in state politics before Election Day.

Democratic Gov. Phil Murphy, who narrowly won a second term over Republican Jack Ciattarelli, called Durr’s posts “outrageous” during a public event Friday. He said he was “stunned” over Sweeney’s loss."

Latest exit from Fed’s board gives Biden three slots to fill

WASHINGTON (AP) — Randal Quarles announced Monday that he will resign from the Federal Reserve’s Board of Governors at the end of the year after completing a four-year term as the central bank’s top bank regulator, opening up another vacancy on the Fed’s influential board for President Joe Biden to fill. Quarles had served as the Fed’s first vice chair of supervision, which gave him wide-ranging authority over the banking system. In that role, Quarles oversaw a broad loosening of the financial regulations that were put in place after the 2008-2009 global financial crisis and recession.

Plenty of pitfalls await Zuckerberg’s ‘metaverse’ plan

SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — Mark Zuckerberg promises that the virtual-reality “metaverse” he’s planning to build will “let you do almost anything.” That might not be such a great idea. On the plus side, as Zuckerberg said in a late October presentation, the metaverse could let you attend virtual concerts with your friends, fence with holograms of Olympic athletes and — best of all — join mixed-reality business meetings. But the dystopian downsides are also easy to imagine, ranging from much more detailed surveillance and data collection to online trolls who can shout into your face instead of just typing nasty messages.

Europe bolsters pioneering tech rules with help from Haugen

LONDON (AP) — European lawmakers have pioneered efforts to rein in big technology companies and are working to strengthen those rules, putting them ahead of the United States and other parts of world. While Europe shares values with the U.S., none of the big tech companies that dominate online life are based on the continent. Some say that allowed European officials to make a more clear-eyed assessment of the risks posed by tech companies largely headquartered in the U.S. Drawing up a new package of digital rules for the 27-nation European Union is getting a boost from Facebook whistleblower Frances Haugen, who answered questions Monday in Brussels from a European Parliament committee.

(AP Photo/J. Scott Applewhite)

WASHINGTON (AP) — The $1 trillion infrastructure plan that now goes to President Joe Biden to sign into law has money for roads, bridges, ports, rail transit, safe water, the power grid, broadband internet and more.

The House passed the bipartisan plan Friday night and Biden said Saturday he will hold a signing ceremony when lawmakers return from a week’s recess.

The new law promises to reach almost every corner of the country. It’s a historic investment that the president has compared to the building of the transcontinental railroad and Interstate Highway System. The White House is projecting that the investments will add, on average, about 2 million jobs per year over the coming decade.

ADVERTISEMENT

The bill cleared the House on a 228-206 vote, ending weeks of intraparty negotiations in which liberal Democrats insisted the legislation be tied to a larger, $1.75 trillion social spending bill — an effort to press more moderate Democrats to support both.

The Senate passed the legislation on a 69-30 vote in August after rare bipartisan negotiations, and the House kept that compromise intact. Thirteen House Republicans voted for the bill, giving Democrats more than enough votes to overcome a handful of defections from progressives.

Here’s a breakdown of the bill:

ROADS AND BRIDGES

The bill would provide $110 billion to repair the nation’s aging highways, bridges and roads. According to the White House, 173,000 total miles or nearly 280,000 kilometers of America’s highways and major roads and 45,000 bridges are in poor condition. And the almost $40 billion for bridges is the single largest dedicated bridge investment since the construction of the national highway system, according to the Biden administration.

PUBLIC TRANSIT

The $39 billion for public transit in the legislation would expand transportation systems, improve accessibility for people with disabilities and provide dollars to state and local governments to buy zero-emission and low-emission buses. The Transportation Department estimates that the current repair backlog is more than 24,000 buses, 5,000 rail cars, 200 stations and thousands of miles of track and power systems.

PASSENGER AND FREIGHT RAIL

To reduce Amtrak’s maintenance backlog, which has worsened since Superstorm Sandy nine years ago, the bill would provide $66 billion to improve the rail service’s Northeast Corridor (457 miles, 735 km), as well as other routes. It’s less than the $80 billion Biden — who famously rode Amtrak from Delaware to Washington during his time in the Senate — originally asked for, but it would be the largest federal investment in passenger rail service since Amtrak was founded 50 years ago.

ADVERTISEMENT

ELECTRIC VEHICLES

The bill would spend $7.5 billion for electric vehicle charging stations, which the administration says are critical to accelerating the use of electric vehicles to curb climate change. It would also provide $5 billion for the purchase of electric school buses and hybrids, reducing reliance on school buses that run on diesel fuel.

INTERNET ACCESS

The legislation’s $65 billion for broadband access would aim to improve internet services for rural areas, low-income families and tribal communities. Most of the money would be made available through grants to states.

MODERNIZING THE ELECTRIC GRID

To protect against the power outages that have become more frequent in recent years, the bill would spend $65 billion to improve the reliability and resiliency of the power grid. It would also boost carbon capture technologies and more environmentally friendly electricity sources like clean hydrogen.

AIRPORTS

The bill would spend $25 billion to improve runways, gates and taxiways at airports and to improve terminals. It would also improve aging air traffic control towers.

WATER AND WASTEWATER

The legislation would spend $55 billion on water and wastewater infrastructure. It has $15 billion to replace lead pipes and $10 billion to address water contamination from polyfluoroalkyl substances — chemicals that were used in the production of Teflon and have also been used in firefighting foam, water-repellent clothing and many other items.

PAYING FOR IT

The five-year spending package would be paid for by tapping $210 billion in unspent COVID-19 relief aid and $53 billion in unemployment insurance aid some states have halted, along with an array of smaller pots of money, like petroleum reserve sales and spectrum auctions for 5G services.

WASHINGTON (AP) — To enforce President Joe Biden’s forthcoming COVID-19 mandate, the U.S. Labor Department is going to need a lot of help. Its Occupational Safety and Health Administration doesn’t have nearly enough workplace safety inspectors to do the job.

So the government will rely upon a corps of informers to identify violations of the order: Employees who will presumably be concerned enough to turn in their own employers if their co-workers go unvaccinated or fail to undergo weekly tests to show they’re virus-free.

What’s not known is just how many employees will be willing to accept some risk to themselves — or their job security — for blowing the whistle on their own employers. Without them, though, experts say the government would find it harder to achieve its goal of requiring tens of millions of workers at companies with 100 or more employees to be fully vaccinated by Jan. 4 or be tested weekly and wear a mask on the job.

ADVERTISEMENT

“There is no army of OSHA inspectors that is going to be knocking on employers door or even calling them,” said Debbie Berkowitz, a former OSHA chief of staff who is a fellow at Georgetown University’s Kalmanovitz Initiative for Labor and the Working Poor. “They’re going to rely on workers and their union representatives to file complaints where the company is totally flouting the law.”

Jim Frederick, the acting chief of OSHA, told reporters that this agency will focus on job sites “where workers need assistance to have a safe and healthy workplace.”

“That typically comes through in the form of a complaint,” Frederick added.

Critics warn that whistleblowers have often faced retaliation from their employers and that OSHA has offered little protection when they do.

The new mandate, which Biden announced last week, is the administration’s most far-reaching step yet to prod more Americans to get a vaccine that has been widely available since early spring. The mandate will cover an estimated 84 million employees.

The president called the move necessary to combat an outbreak that has killed 750,000 Americans and that continues to spread. Companies that fail to comply will face fines of nearly $14,000 per “serious” violation. Employers found to be “willful’’ or repeat violators would be subject to fines of up to ten times that amount.

The mandate has run into furious opposition, though, from leaders of mainly Republican-led states who have condemned the plan as an unlawful case of federal overreach and who immediately challenged the vaccine-or-test requirements in court. On Saturday, the Biden administration endured a setback when a federal appeals court in New Orleans temporarily halted the mandate, saying it posed “grave statutory and constitutional issues.”

ADVERTISEMENT

Should the mandate survive its legal challenges, though, the task of enforcing it would fall on OSHA, the small Labor Department agency that was established 50 years ago to police workplace safety and protect workers from such dangers as toxic chemicals, rickety ladders and cave-ins at construction sites.

OSHA has jurisdiction in 29 states. Other states, including California and Michigan, have their own federally approved workplace safety agencies. These states will have an additional month — until early February — to adopt their own version of the COVID mandate, equal to or tougher than OSHA’s.

For a task as enormous as enforcing the new vaccine mandate, OSHA and its state “partners” are stretched thin. Just 1,850 inspectors will oversee 130 million workers at 8 million job sites. So the agencies must rely on whistleblowers.

OSHA urges workers to first bring unsafe or unhealthy working conditions to the attention of their employers “if possible.” Employees could also file a confidential safety complaint with OSHA or have a case filed by a representative, such as a lawyer, a union representative or a member of the clergy. But they have no right to sue their employer in court for federal safety violations.

Typically, 20% to 25% of OSHA inspections originate with a complaint.

“You fill out a form or somebody fills out a form for you,” said Berkowitz, the former OSHA chief of staff. “And that’s all workers have. If OSHA decides not to inspect, that’s it. Or if OSHA inspects but decides not to cite the employer, that’s it. ... So it’s a pretty weak law.”

Only OSHA can bring cases over violations of the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970, the law that is meant to provide safe workplaces. Going outside OSHA to sue employers for negligence is all but impossible, say Berkowitz and other worker advocates.

State worker compensation programs — which reimburse injured workers for medical costs and lost wages and provide death benefits to survivors of those killed — include no-fault provisions that block most lawsuits.

Even sounding the alarm can be risky.

“Technically,” Berkowitz said, “the law says that companies can’t retaliate against a worker for raising a health and safety issue or filing an OSHA complaint or even reporting an injury. But retaliation is rampant.”

OSHA can pursue employers who punish workers for speaking out against unsafe working conditions. Last month, for example, the agency sued a luxury car dealer in Austin, Texas, that it said fired an employee who had warned co-workers about potential coronavirus hazards in the workplace.

But in a report co-written by Berkowitz, the National Employment Law Project, which advocates for worker rights, found that OSHA dismissed — without investigating — more than half the COVID-related complaints of retaliation it received from whistleblowers. Just 2% of complaints were resolved in the five-month period last year that the law project studied. Workers have just 30 days to file an OSHA complaint over retaliation.

“OSHA needs to improve its handling of whistleblower complaints,” the Labor Department’s Inspector General, its internal watchdog, concluded last year. “When OSHA fails to respond in a timely manner, it could leave workers to suffer emotionally and financially, and may also lead to the erosion of key evidence and witnesses.’’

Still, most companies are considered likely to comply with the COVID mandate, as they mostly do with other OSHA rules. Some employers were likely relieved: They may have wanted to require inoculations on their own but worried that they’d alienate anti-vax workers and possibly lose them to employers that didn’t require vaccinations.

“Most employers — they’re law abiding,” says David Michaels, a former OSHA chief who is an epidemiologist and professor of public health at George Washington University. “They’re trying to make sure that they meet the requirements of every law and regulation .. Now OSHA will follow up. They’ll respond to complaints. They’ll do spot checks. They’ll issue citations and fines, and they’ll make a big deal of those” to discourage other potential violators.

SAN DIEGO (AP) — Parents held children born while they were stuck abroad. Long-separated couples kissed, and grandparents embraced grandchildren who had doubled in age.

The U.S. fully reopened to many vaccinated international travelers Monday, allowing families and friends to reunite for the first time since the coronavirus emerged and offering a boost to the travel industry decimated by the pandemic. The restrictions closed the U.S. to millions of people for 20 months.

Octavio Alvarez and his 14-year-old daughter zipped through a pedestrian crossing in San Diego in less than 15 minutes on their way to visit his mother-in-law in California.

“It’s a big feeling,” said Alvarez, 43, who lives in Ensenada, Mexico, a two-hour drive from San Diego. Prior to the pandemic, his family would visit California twice a month. The emotional cost of the border restrictions were “very high,” he added.

American citizens and permanent residents were always allowed to enter the U.S., but the travel bans grounded tourists, thwarted business travelers and often keep families far apart . Travelers must have proof of vaccination and a negative COVID-19 test.

“I think a lot of people have been waiting for this day,” said Eileen Bigelow, area port director for Vermont for Customs and Border Protection. “They look at it as a light at the end of the tunnel for some return of normalcy.”

There were lots of prolonged hugs at airports from coast to coast. At Newark International Airport in New Jersey, Nirmit Shelat repeatedly embraced his girlfriend, Jolly Dave, after she arrived from India, ending their nine-month separation. She was on the first flight out of the country to the United States.

“I can’t even explain in my words how happy I am,” Dave said.

Gaye Camara, who lives in France, last saw her husband in New York in January 2020, not knowing it would be 21 months before they could hold each other again.

“I’m going to jump into his arms, kiss him, touch him,” said Camara, 40, as she wheeled her luggage through Paris’ Charles de Gaulle airport, where the humming crowds resembled those before the pandemic, except for the face masks.

On the U.S. borders with Mexico and Canada, where traveling back and forth was a way of life before the pandemic , the reopening brought relief. Malls, restaurants and shops in U.S. border towns were devastated by the lack of visitors from Mexico .

San Diego Mayor Todd Gloria, flanked by U.S. and Mexican officials at a celebratory news conference at the San Ysidro crossing, said the economic losses were hefty and the cutting of family ties “immeasurable.”

Retail sales in San Ysidro fell about 75% from pre-COVID levels, forcing nearly 300 businesses to close.

Edith Aguirre of Tijuana took off work to go shopping in San Diego. Bubbling with laughter, she accepted a gift bag from a duty-free store at the San Diego border crossing. She was a regular at SeaWorld in San Diego and last came to the U.S. to celebrate her 50th birthday at Disneyland in February 2020.

“It was very draining,” she said of the interruption to her cross-border life.

Sales dropped in half at David’s Western Wear shop in Nogales, Arizona, which manufactures boots popular among Mexicans.

Owner David Moore hopes his specialty products lure back customers, but he said it won’t happen overnight. Many Mexicans are still trying to get expired visas renewed amid a backlog. Those who do come may be disappointed to find shelves empty because of supply chain problems.

“I really don’t think Mexican shoppers are going to come across in hordes because they have now gotten used to buying a lot of products they need in Mexico,” he said.

David Jerome, president and CEO of the El Paso Chamber of Commerce on Mexico’s border in Texas, said: “It won’t come back as quickly as it was shut off.”

Still, “we feel like we’re getting our neighbors back and we’re glad to get people going back to work,” Jerome said.

Along Canada’s boundary, cross-border hockey rivalries were upended by the travel restrictions. Churches that had members on both sides of the border were suddenly cut off from each other.

But on Monday, border traffic quickly returned.

At Vermont’s busiest international crossing with Canada, U.S. border agents said they began to notice the uptick in border crossing shortly after midnight. By mid-morning, traffic appeared steady.

Travelers at the Peace Bridge in Buffalo, New York, one of the northern border’s busiest crossings, found a 2½-hour wait at 2 a.m., officials said, though within a few hours traffic was flowing more freely. The bridge typically handles about 2 million passenger vehicles from Fort Erie, Ontario, yearly, many of them bound for the region’s shopping malls, ski slopes and sporting events. Volume dropped by more than 90% during the pandemic.

River Robinson’s American partner wasn’t able to be in Canada for the birth of their baby boy 17 months ago. She was thrilled to hear about the U.S. reopening and planned to take the child to the U.S. for Thanksgiving.

It’s “crazy to think he has a whole other side of the family he hasn’t even met yet,” said Robinson, who lives in St. Thomas, Ontario.

Airlines are preparing for a surge in activity — especially from Europe — after the pandemic and resulting restrictions caused international travel to plunge.

The 28 European countries that were barred made up 37% of overseas visitors in 2019, according to the U.S. Travel Association. As the reopening takes effect, carriers are increasing flights between the United Kingdom and the U.S. by 21% this month over last month, according to data from travel and analytics firm Cirium.

In a sign of the huge importance of trans-Atlantic travel for airlines, British Airways and Virgin Atlantic celebrated the reopening by synchronizing the departures of their early morning flights to New York on parallel runways at London’s Heathrow Airport.

Maria Giribet, 74, who lives on the Mediterranean isle of Majorca was headed to San Francisco where she planned to “suffocate” her twin grandchildren with hugs after missing half their lives. Gabriel and David are now 3½.

The U.S. will accept travelers who have been fully vaccinated with any of the shots approved for emergency use by the World Health Organization, not just those in use in the U.S. That’s a relief for many in Canada, where the AstraZeneca vaccine is widely used.

But millions of people around the world who were vaccinated with Russia’s Sputnik V, China’s CanSino or other shots not approved by the WHO will not be able to travel to the U.S.

Testing and quarantine requirements remained obstacles for others. A mobile testing truck was parked near the Peace Bridge in New York, promising results in 30 minutes for $225 and next-day results for $160.

Marcela Picone, 39, of the Buffalo suburb of Williamsville, has been waiting for the day her fiancé and father of her 2- and 3-year-old children can visit from Stoney Creek, Ontario. But his 15-year-old son would have to miss school to quarantine upon their return if they traveled.

“He’s a dad to two American kids,” she said. “He should have had the right to come into this country the entire 19 months.”

(AP) — Eight residents of a nursing home in Connecticut have died during a coronavirus outbreak while 89 residents and employees have tested positive for the disease, nursing home officials say.

The outbreak at the Geer Nursing and Rehabilitation Center in Canaan began Sept. 30, chief executive Kevin O’Connell and nursing director Cady Bloodgood said in a statement Friday.

The eight residents who died had serious health problems, according to the officials. Those who tested positive included 67 residents and 22 staff members. The officials said 48 residents and 21 employees have recovered.

O’Connell told the Republican-American there were no infections at the nearby Geer Lodge, an independent and assisted living center on the campus. He and Bloodgood said virus testing continues biweekly.

“While we must continue with COVID-19 prevention protocols, we want to assure everyone we are doing our best to keep residents and staff safe,” they said.

The nursing home, which houses 82 residents, has suspended in-person visitation, but virtual and window visits can be arranged.

The latest state report on coronavirus infections in nursing homes released Friday said there were 45 confirmed cases among residents and 54 confirmed cases among staff members throughout Connecticut between Oct. 27 and Nov. 9. Three residents died."

LOS ANGELES (AP) — Yoga studio owner David Gross felt relieved after Los Angeles passed a vaccine mandate that is among the strictest in the country, a measure taking effect Monday that requires proof of shots for everyone entering a wide variety of businesses from restaurants to shopping malls and theaters to nail and hair salons.

For Gross, the relief came from knowing he and his co-owner don’t have to unilaterally decide whether to verify their customers are vaccinated. In another part of town, the manager of a struggling nail salon feels trepidation and expects to lose customers. “This is going to be hard for us,” Lucila Vazquez said.

Los Angeles is among a growing number of cities across the U.S., including San Francisco and New York City, requiring people show proof of vaccination to enter various types of businesses and venues. But rules in the nation’s second-most-populous city, called SafePassLA, apply to more types of businesses and other indoor locations including museums and convention centers.

They are being implemented as new cases have started inching up following a sharp decline from an August peak driven by the delta variant.

This was the time of year in 2020 when the worst spike of the pandemic was just beginning in California, which by January saw an average of 500 people die every day. Los Angeles became the state’s epicenter and its hospitals were so overloaded with patients that ambulances idled outside with people struggling to breathe, waiting for beds to open.

So many people died that morgues reached capacity and refrigerated trucks were brought in to handle the overflow. That stark scene played out as coronavirus vaccines arrived and California and Los Angeles moved aggressively to inoculate people.

Among LA county’s roughly 10 million people, 80% of eligible residents now have received at least one COVID-19 vaccine dose and 71% of those eligible are fully vaccinated, according to public health officials.

To guard against anything resembling the January carnage, the LA City Council voted 11-2 last month for the ordinance that requires people 12 and older to be fully vaccinated to enter indoor public spaces including sports arenas, museums, spas, indoor city facilities and other locations.

Negative coronavirus tests within 72 hours of entry to those establishments would be required for people with religious or medical exemptions for vaccinations. Customers without proof can still use outdoor facilities and can briefly enter a business to use a restroom or pick up a food order.

While the order takes effect Monday, city officials say they won’t start enforcing it until Nov. 29 to give businesses time to adjust. A first offense will bring a warning but subsequent ones could produce fines running from $1,000 to $5,000.

Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti, who tested positive for the coronavirus last week while attending the United Nations climate change conference in Scotland, said the mandate will encourage more people to get shots and make businesses safer for employees and customers.

“Vaccinating more Angelenos is our only way out of this pandemic, and we must do everything in our power to keep pushing those numbers up,” Garcetti said.

Business trade groups say the mandate will sow confusion because Los Angeles County’s own vaccine rules — which apply to dozens of surrounding communities — are less sweeping. Cities are allowed to pass rules more stringent than the county’s.

“There’s a tremendous lack of clarity,” said Sarah Wiltfong, senior policy manager at the Los Angeles County Business Federation. For example, most retail shops are exempt. “But shopping malls and shopping centers are included, which of course includes retail shops,” she said.

Harassment of workers who are tasked with verifying vaccination is the top concern of the business federation’s members, Wiltfong said.

“This puts employees in a potential position of conflict, when they’re not necessarily trained to handle situations like that,” she said.

Salons were especially hard hit during the pandemic and were among the last businesses to reopen indoors. Before COVID, Lynda Nail Salon in the Los Feliz neighborhood was regularly filled with clients for hair and nail appointments. On Wednesday morning, only one woman waited for her hair to set.

Vazquez, who manages the business, said she will follow the new rules even though many of her hair clients have said they won’t come in if it requires being vaccinated.

Gyms and yoga studio like the one co-owned by Gross also fall under the order. He doesn’t relish having his employees play the role of enforcer, checking every customer’s vaccination status. But now that the rule is on the books, it’s one less decision he and his partner Lydia Stone have to make as they navigate Highland Park Yoga back to in-person classes.

In anticipation of the new rules, the studio last month started encouraging its regular customers to submit their vaccine cards online so they don’t have to show them at the start of every class. Gross and Stone said it would be heartbreaking to turn away anyone.

“You know, the City Council decided, the mayor signed it, and we we have no choice but to comply with the law,” Gross said, adding that the possibility of being punished for violating the law “would be hugely detrimental” to a yoga business that is barely surviving after being shut down for the bulk of the pandemic."

TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) — Former Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu watched from the sidelines Thursday as the government that toppled him after 12 years in power passed a national budget, dealing a major blow to his hopes of a swift return to the country’s top office.

The man whose shadow loomed so large for so long over Israel, whose rule sparked both mass protests and cult-like devotion, has been relegated to the backbenches as opposition leader, far from the levers of power and exposed to serious corruption charges.

The first budget to be passed in three years, during which a prolonged period of political gridlock brought four divisive elections, was a stress test for Israel’s fractious coalition government.

“It changes the timeframe for him,” said Anshel Pfeffer, a columnist at the left-leaning Haaretz daily and Netanyahu biographer. “It doesn’t mean he’s going to give up. He’s not going to give up. He’s incapable of giving up.”

Failure to pass the budget before November 14 would have resulted in the dissolution of the government and snap elections — giving Netanyahu, who is rising in the polls, a chance at redemption. Now that it has passed, the government — established with the goal of ousting Netanyahu — appears to have bought itself some time. Coalition parties are struggling in the polls and none is likely to want to topple the government and trigger new elections, for now.

Netanyahu’s best hope is that the coalition, made up of eight ideologically diverse parties, implodes over its own contradictions. Otherwise, his next chance will come when the government rotates its leadership in 2023, bringing the centrist Yair Lapid to power and perhaps giving his nationalist coalition partners a reason to bolt.

Aviv Bushinsky, a former Netanyahu aide, said Netanyahu is better off biding his time as opposition leader, a public platform from which he can contest the legal charges and ratchet up support from constituents.

“Right now he’s in no hurry. He has nothing to lose,” he said.

Addressing parliament on Wednesday, ahead of the budget vote, Netanyahu vowed to carry on.

“We will continue to fight this awful government. We will leave no stone unturned, we will look for any way to topple it, to return Israel to the right track,” he said.

Netanyahu, a major figure in Israeli politics for the last quarter century, suffered a dramatic downfall earlier this year.

He began a 12-year run as prime minister in 2009, after an earlier stint in the 1990s, becoming Israel’s longest serving leader and helping to shape the country. He was ubiquitous on the world stage, preaching against Iran’s nuclear program and the accord with world powers meant to rein it in. He ramped up settlement building in the occupied West Bank, avoided peace talks with the Palestinians and presided over three wars against the Hamas militant group ruling Gaza.

He worked hard to convince Israelis that he was a world-class statesman, the only one who could safely guide Israel through its myriad challenges. But under Prime Minister Naftali Bennett , who has travelled to the global climate summit, steered Israel through a fourth COVID-19 wave and passed a budget, that argument has eroded.

“Suddenly you don’t need to be Benjamin Netanyahu to be the prime minister of Israel. And that in itself has sort of been a revelation,” Pfeffer said.

Netanyahu also used his office to divide Israelis, whipping up nationalists against dovish leftists, Jewish Israelis against Palestinian citizens of Israel and railing against the country’s institutions, especially after he was indicted in three corruption cases.

Netanyahu is on trial for fraud, breach of trust and bribery, charges he denies but which clouded his last years in office. Under Israeli law, Netanyahu did not have to step down after being indicted, leaving him a bully pulpit from which he could fight the charges, push to legislate immunity and air his grievances against the media and the judicial system.

After early elections in April 2019, Netanyahu was unable to form a coalition, with some of his former allies refusing to sit in government with him. Israel entered a lengthy political crisis, holding three more elections in less than two years. Protesters around the country descended on city squares and main intersections, demanding Netanyahu resign.

Netanyahu, dubbed a political wizard for repeatedly surviving threats to his rule, saw his magic run out in June, when a disparate constellation of political parties joined forces to oust him. In a Shakespearean twist, Bennett, Netanyahu’s former aide turned rival, was picked to helm the coalition.

Netanyahu, known for enjoying the luxuries of office and hobnobbing with world leaders, was relegated to the post of opposition leader as others swiftly moved into the limelight.

With a robust base and a coterie of loyal lawmakers, he has kept up a lively social media presence and still makes public appearances. His allies heckle and shout over Bennett’s speeches in the Knesset, Israel’s parliament.

But he no longer drives the agenda.

He has done his utmost to undermine the current government, calling it illegitimate, compelling opposition lawmakers to boycott parliamentary committees and vowing to return to office. Israeli media have reported attempts by his right-wing Likud party to lure defectors from the coalition, efforts that have so far been unsuccessful.

Israel’s Justice Minister Gideon Saar, meanwhile, has been promoting legislation that would block an indicted lawmaker from being allowed to form a government, a bill he says was not crafted to target his former mentor.

Netanyahu isn’t expected to resign after the budget defeat, even as some allies lose patience with being out of government, including one who is challenging him for the Likud leadership. Netanyahu is expected to prevail, but the challenge exposes cracks in his hold on the party.

If he does unexpectedly leave parliament, that would likely be what finally topples the coalition.

“The strongest glue binding the coalition is the existence of Netanyahu,” said Avraham Diskin, a political analyst. “If Netanyahu quits, then that presents a serious chance for the coalition to fall.”"

NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) — When the Brothers Osborne take the stage at the CMA Awards on Wednesday, the award-winning duo will have a powerful message for fans who sometimes feel like outsiders — an experience that they know all too well.

The brothers from Deale, Maryland, opened up in recent months about their private lives and personal struggles, with lead singer TJ coming out publicly as gay and guitarist John talking about his anxiety.

The song they will play, “Younger Me,” is a poignant reminder that it does get better. They are proof of that.

“The fact that we get to play a song that is so meaningful, particularly to myself, at a country music award show, it’s one of those things that just kind of transcends the awards itself, money itself, fame,” said TJ Osborne.

The four-time CMA award-winning duo are up for three awards, including album of the year for “Skeletons,” the first time they’ve been nominated in that category.

Even recording their album felt like a series of hurdles to overcome. They had to initially delay recording while John Osborne took time off for therapy to deal his depression and anxiety that had gotten so bad he was seriously reconsidering his musical career.

“I had to go away. I had to turn my phone off. I had to be away from family,” said John Osborne. “I had to restart.”

One thing he learned, and kept learning later when COVID-19 hit, was the world wasn’t going to end if he hit the pause button.

When they resumed recording, TJ was waylaid by salmonella poisoning, then a tornado struck Nashville in March of 2020, knocking out power to the East Nashville neighborhood where they were recording.

By the time they went back to finish the album, the coronavirus pandemic and shutdowns had begun.

“So there was an element to recording ‘Skeletons’ that it felt like it was the end of times, you know,” said John Osborne. “I was like, this might actually be the last record we ever do in our life, and let’s record it as if it is. And it still feels like that to me. We threw all of our chips on the table.”

While TJ Osborne was open about his sexuality with his close friends and family, doubts kept him from deciding on when to publicly announce it. Other country artists waited years to publicly come out, such as Chely Wright and later on Ty Herndon, citing concerns about the effect it might have on their careers.

While there are many other openly gay artists and songwriters currently working in country music, including Brandi Carlile, Brandy Clark, Brooke Eden, Shane McAnally and Lily Rose, Osborne is one of the most prominent.

“Country music is a beautiful genre,” said John Osborne. “But there has been this kind of undercurrent of… there’s a vault and only certain people are allowed in. However, when you go to shows, you see people of all walks of life enjoying it.”

TJ Osborne’s decision to come out publicly also led them to address the divisive political conversations about LGBTQ issues, especially in Tennessee. Tennessee leads the country in enacting new laws that target transgender people, including banning transgender athletes from playing girls’ public school sports.

When a state lawmaker blocked a proposed state resolution to honor TJ Osborne earlier this year, they met with Republican state Rep. Jeremy Faison over lunch to talk.

“It kind of gave the message that maybe people that are gay or LGBTQ really, truly still aren’t that accepted in this state,” TJ Osborne said. “And while that may be true in certain areas of our state, I don’t feel like it is in Nashville, and I think it is a very accepting city here.”

After the resolution was blocked, Brothers Osborne released their music video for “Younger Me” using the steps of the state capitol building as the backdrop.

The black-and-white video, which is nominated for music video of the year at the CMAs, features the band and several young people singing along to the lyrics.

The Brothers Osborne wanted others to see a different message coming from the capitol building — one of inclusivity and acceptance.

“There still is this other big movement here of people... who are accepting and will speak up and will be there for you with open arms,” TJ Osborne said. “And you’re not alone.”

WASHINGTON (AP) — Thousands of intelligence officers could soon face dismissal for failing to comply with the U.S. government’s vaccine mandate, leading Republican lawmakers to raise concerns about removing employees from agencies critical to national security.

Overall, the percentage of intelligence personnel who have been vaccinated is higher than for the American public — 97% at the CIA, for instance. But there are lower percentages in some of the 18-agency intelligence community of approximately 100,000 people, according to Rep. Chris Stewart, R-Utah.

Citing information that he said had been provided to the House Intelligence Committee but not released publicly, Stewart said several intelligence agencies had at least 20% of their workforce unvaccinated as of late October. In some agencies, as many as 40% are unvaccinated, Stewart said. He declined to identify the agencies because full information on vaccination rates was classified.

While many people will likely still get vaccinated before the administration’s Nov. 22 deadline for civilian workers, resistance to the mandate could leave major agencies responsible for national security without some personnel. Intelligence officers are particularly hard to replace due to the highly specialized work they do and the difficulties of completing security clearance checks.

CIA Director William Burns disclosed publicly last week that 97% of the agency’s officers have been vaccinated. The National Reconnaissance Office, which operates U.S. spy satellites, has more than 90% of its workforce vaccinated.

The Office of the Director of National Intelligence declined several requests to provide figures for the intelligence community. The office also would not say what contingency plans are in place in case officers are taken off work due to not complying with the mandate.

Director of National Intelligence Avril Haines declined at a hearing last week to disclose what percentage of the workforce had been vaccinated, but said, “we are not anticipating that it is going to be an issue for mission.”

The vaccination rates provided by Stewart are mostly higher than those of the general U.S. population. About 70% of American adults are fully vaccinated and 80% have received at least one dose of a vaccine.

Stewart called on the administration to approve more exemptions for people on medical, religious and other grounds, and delay any terminations of intelligence officers.

“My question is what’s the impact on national security if we do that?” Stewart said. “You’re potentially firing thousands of people on the same day. And it’s not like you put an ad on Craigslist and have people apply by Thursday.”

Democratic members of the House Intelligence Committee say they’re confident that the vaccination mandate will not cause a problem for the intelligence community. Rep. Jason Crow, D-Colo., said the agencies were doing “quite well” and that getting vaccinated was a sign of an employee’s readiness.

“If somebody is not willing to do what’s necessary to protect their own health and the health of their unit, that actually calls into question their ability to effectively do the job,” Crow said in an interview.

President Joe Biden has issued several mandates to boost the vaccination rate in the U.S. affecting federal employees, contractors and health care workers. The White House has credited those mandates with driving up vaccination rates and reducing deaths from a pandemic that has killed more than 750,000 people in the U.S. and 5 million people worldwide.

Federal regulators and independent health experts have certified that the available vaccines are safe. A recent Centers for Disease Control and Prevention study found that from April to July, unvaccinated people were 10 times more likely than vaccinated people to be hospitalized and 11 times more likely to die of COVID-19.

Mandates to get vaccinated have faced significant resistance , particularly given an already-tight market for businesses looking to hire workers. Some first responders have resisted vaccine mandates as have employee unions, arguing that mandates impinge on personal freedom.

The Biden administration classified information it gave the intelligence committee on each of the nation’s 18 intelligence agencies, said Stewart, who noted generally that agencies more closely affiliated with the military tended to report lower vaccination rates.

Several major agencies with large military components all declined to provide their vaccination rate when asked by The Associated Press, including the National Security Agency, the Defense Intelligence Agency and the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency. The NGA, which produces intelligence from satellites and drones, said in a statement that it was “working to ensure that all members of the workforce understand the process and documentation required” prior to the deadline.

Stewart, a former Air Force pilot, has been vaccinated but said he opposes mandates as being intrusive and counterproductive.

“If you say, ‘you have to do this and we won’t consider any exceptions to that,’ that’s where you get people to dig in their heels,” he said.

Rep. Darin LaHood, an Illinois Republican, echoed Stewart’s concerns in a hearing last week and told agency leaders that the question of unvaccinated employees “affects all of you and us globally.”

Sen. Mark Warner, D-Va., the chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, said in a statement that he supported requiring vaccinations for federal employees. “We need to be using every tool at our disposal to save lives and protect mission readiness,” Warner said.

Federal employees who aren’t vaccinated or haven’t received an exemption by Nov. 22 could face a suspension of 14 days or fewer, followed by possible dismissal. The General Services Administration has advised agencies that “unique operational needs of agencies and the circumstances affecting a particular employee may warrant departure from these guidelines if necessary.”

Steve Morrison, director of the Global Health Policy Center at the Washington-based Center for Strategic & International Studies, said the vaccine mandate was still relatively new and he expected the numbers to change before the administration’s cutoff.

Morrison said that as intelligence agencies broadly work with unvaccinated employees, “they’re going to have to show some flexibility around the margins without compromising away the basic strategy and goals.”

“Getting control over this pandemic in the United States requires getting to a much higher level of vaccine coverage,” Morrison said. “It’s a matter of national security.”"

(AP) — Business leaders in nine Midwest and Plains states indicate significant jumps were made in employment and inventories over the last month, but confidence in the economy over the next six month remained at a dismal low, according to a new monthly survey.

The overall index for October of the Creighton University Mid-America Business Conditions released Monday rose to 65.2 from September’s 61.6.

Any score above 50 on the survey’s indexes suggests growth, while a score below 50 suggests recession.

But the survey’s business confidence index, which looks ahead six months, failed to budge from 37 recorded in September. That’s the lowest reading the confidence index has reached since March 2020, when the global COVID-19 pandemic began.

The report indicates that the region is adding manufacturing business activity at a positive but somewhat slower pace.

“Almost one-third of supply managers reported that inventory stockpiling has contributed significantly to supply chain bottlenecks,” said Creighton University economist Ernie Goss. who oversees the monthly survey.

Business leaders reported strong job growth, with the employment index rising to 66.1 in October from September’s 56.7. Even so, the region has yet to recover all job losses from the pandemic, Goss said.

Wholesale prices continue to climb, with that index registering 96.5 from September’s 94.9, indicating growing pressure from inflation.

The monthly survey covers Arkansas, Iowa, Kansas, Minnesota, Missouri, Nebraska, North Dakota, Oklahoma and South Dakota."

NEW DELHI (AP) — Indians across the country began celebrating Diwali, the Hindu festival of lights, on Thursday amid concerns over the coronavirus pandemic and rising air pollution.

Diwali is typically celebrated by socializing and exchanging gifts with family and friends. Many light oil lamps or candles to symbolize a victory of light over darkness, and fireworks are set off as part of the celebrations.

Last year, celebrations in India were upended by a renewed spike in COVID-19 infections, but festivities this year seem to be back. Even though the government has asked people to avoid large gatherings, markets have been buzzing ahead of Diwali, with eager crowds buying flowers, lanterns and candles.

As dusk fell on Wednesday, over 900,000 earthen lamps were lit and kept burning for 45 minutes in the northern city of Ayodhya in Uttar Pradesh state, retaining the Guinness World Record it set last year. As part of the Diwali celebrations, the city last year lit 606,569 oil lamps.

The lamps were lit at Ram ki Pauri, at the banks of Saryu River, a stunning spectacle for thousands of visitors who thronged its shores while ignoring coronavirus social distancing norms. A laser and fireworks show followed, illuminating the city’s lanes and river banks. Thousands of city residents also lit lamps at their houses and temples.

The festival is being celebrated at a time when India’s pandemic crisis has largely subsided.

On Thursday, the country recorded over 12,000 new coronavirus cases and 461 deaths, a far cry from earlier this year when India buckled under a few hundred thousand new infections every day. Overall, it has recorded more than 35 million infections and over 459,000 deaths, according to the Health Ministry. These figures, as elsewhere, are likely undercounts.

Even states where infections were swelling a few weeks ago, such as Kerala along the tropical Malabar Coast, have seen a sustained decline. India also celebrated administering its billionth COVID-19 vaccine dose last month, further boosting confidence that life is returning to normal.

Still, experts have warned that the festival season could bring a renewed spike in infections if COVID-19 health measures aren’t enforced.

There are also worries over air pollution, which typically shrouds northern India under a toxic grey smog at this time as temperatures dip and winter settles in.

On Diwali night, people also lit up the sky with firecrackers — their smoke causing pollution that takes days to clear.

While there is no nationwide ban on bursting firecrackers, a number of states have imposed restrictions to stem the pollution, with some allowing their residents to light green crackers for a certain number of hours. Green crackers produce lesser emissions than normal firecrackers. In the past, similar bans have often been flouted.

WASHINGTON (AP) — President Joe Biden’s top economic adviser expressed confidence Sunday that the White House’s $1.85 trillion domestic policy package will quickly pass the House this week and said approval couldn’t come at a more urgent time as prices of consumer goods spike.

“Inflation is high right now. And it is affecting consumers in their pocketbook and also in their outlook for the economy,” said Brian Deese, director of the National Economic Council.

“This, more than anything, will go at the costs that Americans face,” he said, before adding that the House will consider the legislation this coming week. “It will get a vote, it will pass.”

The House has been moving toward approval of the massive Democrat-only-backed bill even as the measure faces bigger challenges in the Senate, where Sens. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., and Kyrsten Sinema, D-Ariz., have insisted on reducing its size.

ADVERTISEMENT

In a letter Sunday to Democratic colleagues, Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., counseled “time and patience” for working through a bill of this size.

Consumer prices have soared 6.2% over the last year , the biggest 12-month jump since 1990. Deese acknowledged that prices may not fully return to a more normal 2% level until next year due to the lingering effects of COVID-19, but he said the measure will go a long way toward “lowering costs for American families.”

“We’re confident this bill, as it moves through the process, is going to be fully paid for, and not only that, it’s actually going to reduce deficits over the long term,” he said.

Biden on Monday planned to sign a related $1 trillion infrastructure bill , a bipartisan effort that was passed earlier this month after the president and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., pledged action on Biden’s broader package expanding health, child, elder care and climate change by mid-November.

House progressives had threatened to hold up the infrastructure bill without a firm commitment of immediate action on the broader package.

House centrists say they will vote for the package as early as this week if an upcoming Congressional Budget Office analysis affirms White House estimates that the bill is fully paid for. The measure would be covered with changes to corporate taxes, such as a new corporate minimum tax, while raising taxes on higher-income people.

On Friday, Pelosi wrote Democratic members reaffirming her plan to push ahead soon, noting that CBO estimates released so far on pieces of the plan have been consistent with White House projections.

ADVERTISEMENT

“We are on a path to be further fortified with numbers from the Congressional Budget Office,” she said.

Rep. Fred Upton, R-Mich., one of 13 House Republicans who voted for the infrastructure bill, said he’s not convinced that the broader package will get House approval this week.

“I don’t think the votes are there yet,” he said. “A good number of Democrats had demanded and are going to receive a CBO report as to whether is, it really paid for? What does it do when you expand Medicare? What does that do to the solvency?”

“Somehow, I don’t think we’re going to get these answers ... for Pelosi to get the votes set before the end of the week.”

The bill is expected to face changes in the Senate. With Republican opposition and an evenly split 50-50 Senate, Biden has no votes to spare.

Manchin in particular has been vocal about the risk of aggravating budget shortfalls and already has managed to bring the bill down from Biden’s original $3.5 trillion price tag. Last week, Manchin again sounded the alarm over “the threat posed by record inflation.”

Deese appeared on CNN’s “State of the Union” and ABC’s “This Week” and Upton spoke on CNN."

OAKLAND, Calif. (AP) — U.S. food banks already dealing with increased demand from families sidelined by the pandemic now face a new challenge — surging food prices and supply chain issues walloping the nation.

The higher costs and limited availability mean some families may get smaller servings or substitutions for staples such as peanut butter, which some food banks are buying for nearly double what it cost two years ago. As holidays approach, some food banks worry they won’t have enough stuffing and cranberry sauce for Thanksgiving and Christmas.

“What happens when food prices go up is food insecurity for those who are experiencing it just gets worse,” said Katie Fitzgerald, chief operating officer of Feeding America, a nonprofit organization that coordinates the efforts of more than 200 food banks across the country.

Food banks that expanded to meet unprecedented demand brought on by the pandemic won’t be able to absorb forever food costs that are two to three times what they used to be, she said.

Supply chain disruptions, lower inventory and labor shortages have all contributed to increased costs for charities on which tens of millions of people in the U.S. rely on for nutrition. Donated food is more expensive to move because transportation costs are up, and bottlenecks at factories and ports make it difficult to get goods of all kinds.

If a food bank has to swap out for smaller sizes of canned tuna or make substitutions in order to stretch their dollars, Fitzgerald said, it’s like adding “insult to injury” to a family reeling from uncertainty.

In the prohibitively expensive San Francisco Bay Area, the Alameda County Community Food Bank in Oakland is spending an extra $60,000 a month on food. Combined with increased demand, it is now shelling out $1 million a month to distribute 4.5 million pounds (2 million kilograms) of food, said Michael Altfest, the Oakland food bank’s director of community engagement.

Pre-pandemic, it was spending a quarter of the money for 2.5 million pounds (1.2 million kilograms) of food.

The cost of canned green beans and peaches is up nearly 9% for them, Altfest said; canned tuna and frozen tilapia up more than 6%; and a case of 5-pound frozen chickens for holiday tables is up 13%. The price for dry oatmeal has climbed 17%.

On Wednesdays, hundreds of people line up outside a church in east Oakland for its weekly food giveaway. Shiloh Mercy House feeds about 300 families on those days, far less than the 1,100 families it was nourishing at the height of the pandemic, said Jason Bautista, the charity’s event manager. But he’s still seeing new people every week.

ADVERTISEMENT

“And a lot of people are just saying they can’t afford food,” he said. “I mean they have the money to buy certain things, but it’s just not stretching.”

Families can also use a community market Shiloh opened in May. Refrigerators contain cartons of milk and eggs while sacks of hamburger buns and crusty baguettes sit on shelves.

Oakland resident Sonia Lujan-Perez, 45, picked up chicken, celery, onions bread and and potatoes — enough to supplement a Thanksgiving meal for herself, 3-year-old daughter and 18-year-old son. The state of California pays her to care for daughter Melanie, who has special needs, but it’s not enough with monthly rent at $2,200 and the cost of milk, citrus, spinach and chicken so high.

“That is wonderful for me because I will save a lot of money,” she said, adding that the holiday season is rough with Christmas toys for the children.

Many people also rely on other government aid, including the federal Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP.

Kate Waters, a spokeswoman for the USDA, which administers the SNAP program, said there were no immediate plans for an emergency boost in SNAP benefits to compensate for the rising food costs. But she said that previous moves by the Biden administration such as the permanent increase in SNAP benefits earlier this year and a fresh wave of funding for food banks should help ease the burden. In addition, Waters said the fact that schools are open and offering free lunches and, in some cases, free breakfast, should also help.

Bryan Nichols, vice president of sales for Transnational Foods Inc., which delivers to more than 100 food banks associated with Feeding America, said canned foods from Asia— such as fruit cocktail, pears and mandarin oranges— have been stuck overseas because of a lack of shipping container space.

Issues in supply seem to be improving and prices stabilizing, but he expects costs to stay high after so many people got out of the shipping business during the pandemic. “An average container coming from Asia prior to COVID would cost about $4,000. Today, that same container is about $18,000,” he said.

At the Care and Share Food Bank for Southern Colorado in Colorado Springs, CEO Lynne Telford says the cost for a truckload of peanut butter —40,000 pounds (18,100 kilograms)_has soared 80% from June 2019 to $51,000 in August. Mac and cheese is up 19% from a year ago and the wholesale cost of ground beef has increased 5% in three months. They’re spending more money to buy food to make up for waning donations and there’s less to choose from.

The upcoming holidays worry her. For one thing, the donation cost to buy a frozen turkey has increased from $10 to $15 per bird.

“The other thing is that we’re not getting enough holiday food, like stuffing and cranberry sauce. So we’re having to supplement with other kinds of food, which you know, makes us sad,” said Telford, whose food bank fed more than 200,000 people last year, distributing 25 million pounds (11.3 million kilograms) of food.

Alameda County Community Food Bank says it is set for Thanksgiving, with cases of canned cranberry and boxes of mashed potatoes among items stacked in its expanded warehouse. Food resourcing director Wilken Louie ordered eight truckloads of frozen 5-pound chickens —which translates into more than 60,000 birds— to give away free, as well as half-turkeys available at cost.

For that, Martha Hasal is grateful.

“It’s going to be an expensive Thanksgiving, turkey is not going to cost like the way it was,” said Hasal as she loaded up on on cauliflower and onions on behalf of the Bay Area American Indian Council. “And they’re not giving out turkey. So thank God they’re giving out the chicken.”

HOUSTON (AP) — Most of the season, it just seemed this wasn’t their year.

They dropped their first four games, and soon injuries piled up. They lost their most dynamic player before the All-Star break. They were stuck below .500 in August.

Yet out of nowhere, suddenly, these Atlanta Braves transformed themselves and took off.

Jorge Soler, Freddie Freeman and the Braves breezed to their first World Series championship since 1995, hammering the Houston Astros 7-0 on Tuesday night in Game 6. Max Fried threw six dominant innings in a signature pitching performance to close it out.

“We hit every pothole, every bump you could possibly hit this year,” Freeman said. “Injuries, every single kind of thing that could happen, that could go wrong went wrong, and we overcame every single one of those things.”

How proud Hank Aaron would’ve been.

Even so, Atlanta’s troubles never fully went away.

General manager Alex Anthopoulos, the architect of the Braves’ midseason turnaround, missed this crowning achievement after testing positive for COVID-19. He was back home for the clincher.

Soler, a July acquisition who tested positive for the coronavirus in the playoffs, backed Fried early with a monster three-run shot for his third homer against the Astros.

Freeman hit an RBI double and then punctuated the romp with a solo home run in the seventh that made it 7-0.

By then, it was a total team effort. Ailing star Ronald Acuña Jr., the dynamo of Atlanta’s future, bounded from the dugout to join the celebration for Freeman, the longtime face of the franchise.

When Yuli Gurriel grounded out to end it, Freeman caught the throw at first base, put the ball in his pocket, and the party was on for manager Brian Snitker’s club.

A full hour after the game, hundreds of Braves fans packed behind the team’s third base dugout kept doing the chop and chant, causing loud echoes to bounce around the ballpark.

About 700 miles away at suburban Truist Park, thousands of fans poured into the Braves’ home to holler.

A mere afterthought in the summer heat among the land of the Giants, White Sox and Dodgers, but magnificent in the Fall Classic.

“This is the toughest team I’ve ever been a part of,” said shortstop Dansby Swanson, who also homered.

Soler tapped his heart twice before beginning his home run trot after connecting off rookie Luis Garcia in the third inning, sending the ball flying completely out of Minute Maid Park and clinching the Series MVP award.

ADVERTISEMENT

By the end, nothing could stop them. Not a broken leg sustained by starter Charlie Morton in the World Series opener. Not a big blown lead in Game 5.

Steadied by the 66-year-old Snitker, an organization man for four decades, the underdog Braves won the franchise’s fourth title.

“They never gave up on themselves,” he said on a postgame victory platform. “We lost a lot of pieces over the course of the summer and it was just the next man up.”

Consider it a tribute to the greatest Braves player of them all. Aaron died Jan. 22 at 86, still pulling for his old team, and The Hammer’s legacy was stamped all over this Series.

“Nobody ever wanted to let Hank down,” Snitker said. “That’s just the way it was, we didn’t want to let him down. He charged us with a responsibility to make these guys better and we weren’t going to let him down.”

And note the Braves outhomered the top-scoring team in the majors by 11-2.

For 72-year-old Houston manager Dusty Baker, a disappointment. But for many fans rooting against the Astros in the wake of their 2017 sign-stealing scandal, some satisfaction.

“Yeah, it’s tough, but you know something? You’ve got to keep on trucking, and that gives you even more incentive next year,” Baker said.

“It’s tough to take now, but this too shall pass. I mean, it really hurts, but it’s over,” he added.

Major credit for Atlanta’s title goes to Anthopoulos. Undaunted by Acuña’s knee injury, he pulled off a flurry of July trades that brought the Fab Four to an entirely retooled outfield — NL Championship Series MVP Eddie Rosario, Adam Duvall, Joc Pederson and Soler.

“Thanks to God for the opportunity to be on this team,” Soler said through a translator.

But even in the Analytics Era, guided by a GM fully versed in new-age ways, the path these Braves took wouldn’t add up in any computer. Especially with how things looked in midseason.

“At that time, we were searching,” third baseman Austin Riley said before Game 6. “I think there’s no question about that.”

Minus Acuña, Atlanta wasn’t over .500 for a single day until the first week in August. The Braves finished 88-73 for the 12th-best record in the majors and fewest victories among playoff teams; their win total was the lowest for a World Series champion since St. Louis’ 83 in 2006.

Plus, some agonizing history in Atlanta, a city where no team had won a title in the four major pro sports besides 1995.

The Braves couldn’t convert a 3-1 series advantage over the Dodgers in the NLCS last year. The Hawks fell short in the Eastern Conference finals last season. And then there was the big one, the Falcons blowing a 28-3 lead to the Patriots in the Super Bowl.

But these Braves, not this time.

“Boy, we’re in November right now and we’ve been doing this since February. We’ve had so many ups and downs this year. For us to be world champions, that is awesome to hear,” Freeman said.

Favored in spring training to win their fourth straight NL East title, the Braves lost Acuña to a torn knee in July. Earlier, 2020 Triple Crown contender Marcell Ozuna was injured and later placed on leave while Major League Baseball investigated him under its domestic violence policy. Projected ace Mike Soroka never made it back from an Achilles injury.

Going into the playoffs, their bullpen was a crazy patchwork.

They had a guy who made his big league debut in October, a lefty who was pitching in 2019 for the Texas AirHogs in a now-defunct independent league and a righty who was stacking boxes at an appliance warehouse a decade ago. Toss in a rookie who was off the roster a week ago as he watched Game 1 at a hotel in suburban Atlanta.

For sure, plenty of fans around the country were rooting hard against Jose Altuve and the Houston crew. Many continue to heckle them as the “Cheatin’ Astros” for an illegal sign-stealing scheme on the way to their 2017 title, and those feelings might last forever.

Certainly a lot of people were cheering for Baker. A World Series winner as a player and a highly respected figure on and off the field, he wasn’t able to check the final box on his resume as a championship skipper.

The Braves’ crowns have been spread out over more than a century.

The 1995 Atlanta champs featured five future Hall of Famers — rookie Chipper Jones, aces Tom Glavine, Greg Maddux and John Smoltz, and manager Bobby Cox. Those rings were the lone pieces of hardware that resulted from 14 straight division titles.

The 1957 Milwaukee Braves were led by Aaron in his only NL MVP season. The Hall of Famer’s 44 was painted in large numbers on the outfield grass at Truist Park, and Baker and Snitker often mentioned how much he’d meant to them.

There were the 1914 Boston Braves, too, dubbed the “Miracle Braves” back in the day. In last place on the Fourth of July, they surged to win the pennant, then upset a heavily favored team — the Philadelphia A’s — to earn their nickname.

Sound familiar?

“This double standard has caused confusion and distress among federal employees due to disparate treatment and incongruent deadlines for people who perform the government’s work in the same settings,” the union’s president, Everett Kelley, wrote in a letter Tuesday.

“It is inexcusable that contractors are being given the entire holiday season to meet the mandates, while federal employees continue to be subject to the November 22 deadline,” Kelley added. “The effect upon morale of federal employees being subject to possible discipline at this time of the year cannot be overstated.”

White House Coronavirus Response Coordinator Jeff Zients has said federal employees who chose to buck the mandate will receive “counseling” and could later be suspended and even terminated.

“It’s important to remember that this is a process and the point here is to get people vaccinated, not to punish them,” Zients said last month. “Agencies will not be removing employees from federal service until after they’ve gone through a process of education and counseling.”

A federal appeals court on Saturday temporarily stayed the Biden administration’s mandate directing private-sector workers to get vaccinated against COVID-19.

The three-judge panel in the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals temporarily blocked the new federal mandate for companies with more than 100 employees to require their workers to get vaccinated, or submit to weekly tests and masking. Those that defy the rules face fines as high as $14,000 per violation.

On Thursday, the Biden administration rolled out the mandate as its latest effort to goad tens of millions of unvaccinated workers to get the jab. The requirement was scheduled to take effect Jan. 4 and would affect about 84 million workers.

Western Australia is the largest state, covering a third of Australia’s land area. It also has the nation’s lowest vaccination rates, in part because the state has had few infections and life has been relatively normal throughout the pandemic.

Western Australia is the only Australian state or territory that does not intend to reopen this year. Vaccinated Australians have been free to travel the world through east coast airports in coronavirus-affected Sydney and Melbourne since Monday when a 20-month-old international travel ban was lifted.

Western Australia Premier Mark McGowan on Friday set a vaccination target of 90 per cent of the population aged 12 and older for the border restrictions to be relaxed. The milestone was forecast to be reached in late January or early February.

McGowan said he would set a date for the state to reopen once 80 per cent of the target population had been vaccinated, which is expected to happen in mid-December.

Once that reopening date was set, it would stand even if the vaccination rate fell short of 90 per cent by then.

“As far as world standards go, a rate of 90 per cent will be an amazing achievement,” McGowan said.

“Given our current vaccination rates, these targets are realistic and within our sights,” he added.

Only 63.7 per cent of the target population in Western Australia was fully vaccinated, according to state data. Nationally, 79.6 per cent of the population aged 16 and older were fully vaccinated, according to federal government data released on Friday.

Other states have or intend to substantially relax pandemic restrictions once 80 per cent of their populations aged 16 and older are vaccinated.

Western Australia’s sparsely populated north has some of the lowest vaccination rates in the country.

McGowan said parts of the state could be isolated by intrastate borders if their vaccination rates continued to lag. Such areas include the Pilbara region where the nation’s lucrative iron ore mining operations are based.

“Cutting off the Pilbara, or any region for that matter, is not something I want to do,” McGowan said.

“But if that’s what is required to protect the local community and local industries, then we will take that step based on the health advice at the time,” he added.

Government modelling showed that reopening that state at the 90 per cent vaccination benchmark rather than 80 per cent would mean COVID-19 cases occupying 70 per cent fewer hospital beds, 75 per cent few intensive care beds and 63 per cent fewer deaths, McGowan said.

“The difference in easing border controls at 90 per cent rather than 80 per cent is 200 West Australian lives are saved,” McGowan said.

If the state falls short of the 250,000 additional people it needs to get vaccinated to reach the 90 per cent target, additional pandemic measures will be required on the date it reopens, McGowan said.

Western Australia has accounted for only nine of Australia’s 1,781 COVID-19 deaths.

Four of those deaths were passengers and crew from the German-operated cruise ship MV Artania who were brought ashore for hospital treatment in the capital Perth. The state’s last COVID-19 death was reported in April 2020.

The NBA informed players and coaches that they must receive a booster shot if they took the single-dose Johnson & Johnson coronavirus vaccine, ESPN reported.

After an agreement with the National Basketball Players Association, the league ruled that any employees and players who took the J&J shot more than two months ago must get a booster. The booster is also required of those who took the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines more than six months ago.

“Data used to make the league’s determinations showed that antibody levels for Pfizer and Moderna recipients wane after six months and after two months for Johnson & Johnson recipients,” ESPN reported.

The league added that those who refuse to take the booster would be subject to testing on game day and over and over again during the rest of the week.

For now, the NBA is making this a “recommendation,” however that is what officials said at the beginning of the pandemic chaos and later made it a requirement.

The switch to requiring the vaccine forced Brooklyn Nets star Kyrie Irving to skip the 2021 season up to this point and perhaps until the end f the season due to his decision to forego the vaccine.

It is highly likely that the league will eventually require the booster shot.

It is the first country to OK the treatment, although it was not immediately clear how quickly the pill would be available.

The pill was licensed for adults 18 and older who have tested positive for COVID-19 and have at least one risk factor for developing severe disease, such as obesity or heart disease. The drug, known as molnupiravir, is intended to be taken twice a day for five days by people at home with mild to moderate COVID-19.

An antiviral pill that reduces symptoms and speeds recovery could prove groundbreaking, easing caseloads on hospitals and helping to curb outbreaks in poorer countries with fragile health systems. It would also bolster the two-pronged approach to the pandemic: treatment, by way of medication, and prevention, primarily through vaccinations.

Molnupiravir is also pending review at regulators in the U.S., the European Union and elsewhere. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration announced last month it would convene a panel of independent experts to scrutinize the pill’s safety and effectiveness in late November.

Initial supplies will be limited. Merck has said it can produce 10 million treatment courses through the end of the year, but much of that supply has already been purchased by governments worldwide.

In October, UK officials announced they secured 480,000 courses of molnupiravir and expected thousands of vulnerable Britons to have access to the treatment this winter via a national study.

“Today is a historic day for our country, as the UK is now the first country in the world to approve an antiviral that can be taken at home for COVID-19,” said Britain’s health secretary, Sajid Javid.

“We are working at pace across the government and with the NHS to set out plans to deploy molnupiravir to patients through a national study as soon as possible,” he said in a statement, referring to the UK’s National Health Service. Doctors said the treatment would be particularly significant for people who do not respond well to vaccination.

Merck and its partner Ridgeback Biotherapeutic have requested clearance for the drug with regulators around the world to treat adults with mild-to-moderate COVID-19 who are at risk for severe disease or hospitalization. That’s roughly the same group targeted for treatment with infused COVID-19 antibody drugs, the standard of care in many countries for patients who don’t yet require hospitalization.

Merck announced preliminary results last month showing its drug cut hospitalizations and deaths by half among patients with early COVID-19 symptoms. The results have not yet been peer reviewed or published in a scientific journal.

The company also did not disclose details on molnupiravir’s side effects, except to say that rates of those problems were similar between people who got the drug and those who received dummy pills.

The drug targets an enzyme the coronavirus uses to reproduce itself, inserting errors into its genetic code that slow its ability to spread and take over human cells. That genetic activity has led some independent experts to question whether the drug could potentially cause mutations leading to birth defects or tumors.

Britain’s Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency said molnupiravir’s ability to interact with DNA and cause mutations had been studied “extensively” and that it was not found to pose a risk to humans.

“Studies in rats showed that (molnupiravir) may cause harmful effects to the unborn offspring, although this was at doses which were higher than those that will be given to humans, and these effects were not observed in other animals,” the agency said in an email.

In company trials, both men and women were instructed to either use contraception or abstain from sex. Pregnant women were excluded from the study. Merck has stated that the drug is safe when used as directed.

Molnupiravir was initially studied as a potential flu therapy with funding from the U.S. government. Last year, researchers at Emory University decided to repurpose the drug as a potential COVID-19 treatment. They then licensed the drug to Ridgeback and its partner Merck.

Last week, Merck agreed to allow other drugmakers to make its COVID-19 pill, in a move aimed at helping millions of people in poorer countries get access. The Medicines Patent Pool, a United Nations-backed group, said Merck will not receive royalties under the agreement for as long as the World Health Organization deems COVID-19 to be a global emergency.

But the deal was criticized by some activists for excluding many middle-income countries capable of making millions of treatments, including Brazil and China.

Still, experts commended Merck for agreeing to widely share its formula and promising to help any companies who need technological help in making their drug – something no coronavirus vaccine producers have agreed to.

“Unlike the grotesquely unequal distribution of COVID-19 vaccines, the poorest countries will not have to wait at the back of the queue for molnupiravir,” said Dr. Mohga Kamal-Yanni, a senior health adviser to the People’s Vaccine Alliance. Fewer than 1% of the world’s COVID-19 vaccines have gone to poor countries and experts hope easier-to-dispense treatments will help them curb the pandemic.

Previously Merck announced licensing deals with several Indian makers of generic drugs to manufacture lower-cost versions of molnupiravir for developing countries.

The U.S. reportedly paid roughly $700 per course of the drug for about 1.7 million treatments. Merck says it plans to use a tiered pricing strategy for developing countries. A review by Harvard University and King’s College London estimated the drug costs about $18 to make.

While other treatments have been cleared to treat COVID-19, including steroids and monoclonal antibodies, those are administered by injection or infusion and are mostly for hospitalized patients.

On Friday, a majority of 62 in the 100-seat Saeima (Parliament) of Latvia voted in favour of mandating proof of vaccination or recovery from the Wuhan virus for elected officials.

Starting on Monday, MPs who fail to present documentation of vaccination or recovery will have their pay suspended and will be barred from participating in parliamentary votes, the governing body said in a statement.

“From November 15, an MP will be entitled to participate in the work of the Saeima only if he or she has presented a digital COVID-19 certificate confirming the fact of vaccination or [recovery from] illness,” the parliament announced.

“The payment of a monthly salary and compensation will be suspended for a Saeima MP who will not be entitled to participate in the work of the parliament,” the statement added.

The law, which will be in effect until at least July 1st of next year, also applies to officials in local councils as well.

The chairman of the Defence, Home Affairs, and Corruption Prevention Commission which spearheaded the legislation, Juris Rancāns, said that it was necessary to promote public confidence in the vaccination programme.

Latvia has had one of the lowest vaccine uptakes in the European Union, with only 53.6 per cent of the country receiving two doses of a vaccine compared to the EU average of 64.9 per cent, according to Euronews.

After easing the national lockdown initiated last month, Latvia will join Austria next week in introducing a two-tiered society in which lockdown restrictions will apply but only to the unvaccinated.

The unvaccinated will have limits placed on them in terms of attending public and private events, entering shops, and receiving in-person education, Latvian news agency Leta reported.

On Friday, Austria announced that unvaccinated citizens in some regions will be prohibited from leaving their homes, with exceptions being carved out to buy groceries or to visit a doctor. The Austrian government is also planning on making vaccination a requirement for healthcare workers, although a deadline has yet to be specified.

Latvia is also not unique in requiring vaccination for MPs, with both Canada and the lockdown-happy Australian state of Victoria declaring in October that unvaccinated politicians will be prohibited from entering parliament.

Independent MP Catherine Cumming accused the local government at the time of attempting to crush dissent against the extension of emergency coronavirus powers by banning unvaccinated MPs.

“This seems to be a blatant attempt to make it easier for the government to get this legislation passed,” she said.

The survey asked respondents, “The Food and Drug Administration has recently approved COVID-19 vaccines for children as young as five years old. How concerned are you about the safety of COVID-19 vaccination for children?”

Sixty percent expressed concern. That includes 78 percent of Republicans, 61 percent of independents, and 46 percent of Democrats. Overall, 39 percent are “very” concerned.

The survey also asked if public schools should make the vaccine “mandatory” for students. That remains an unpopular idea, as 55 percent said “no,” public schools should not. Over three-quarters of Republicans and 61 percent of independents hold the same sentiments, while 61 percent of Democrats said “yes,” public schools should mandate the vaccine for schoolchildren.

Via Rasmussen Reports:

Among Americans who are opposed to making COVID-19 vaccines mandatory for public school students, 82% are concerned about the safety of COVID-19 vaccination for children, including 59% who are Very Concerned. More blacks (67%) and other minorities (66%) than whites (57%) are concerned about the safety of COVID-19 vaccination for children. However, blacks (46%) are less likely than whites (55%) or other minorities (58%) to oppose making vaccination mandatory for public school students.

The survey follows U.S. health officials’ approval of Pfizer’s coronavirus vaccine for 5-11-year-olds. With that, President Biden is begging parents to get their children vaccinated despite the fact that many hold concerns about safety.

This week, U.S. Surgeon General Dr. Vivek Murthy responded after left-wing actor Matthew McConaughey expressed hesitancy for the vaccination of his children.

“Many kids have died. Sadly, hundreds of children — thousands — have been hospitalized, and as a dad of a child who has been hospitalized several years ago for another illness, I would never wish upon any parent they have a child that ends up in the hospital,” Murthy said during an appearance on CNN.

“And the vaccines have shown in these trials for children 5 through 11 they are more at 90 percent effective in protecting our kids from symptomatic infection,” he continued, claiming them to be “remarkably safe.”

However, coronavirus hospitalizations and fatalities among children remain extremely low, as Breitbart News detailed:

According to the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP), “among states reporting, children ranged from 1.7%-4.2% of their total cumulated hospitalizations, and 0.1%-2.0% of all their child COVID-19 cases resulted in hospitalization.” The mortality rate among children is even lower, accounting for 0.00 percent to 0.26 percent of all COVID-19 deaths. According to AAP, “7 states reported zero child death,” and “in states reporting, 0.00%-0.03% of all child COVID-19 cases resulted in death.”

“The Ellume COVID-19 Home Test is an antigen test that detects proteins from the SARS-CoV-2 virus from a nasal sample in people two years of age or older,” the FDA said in its announcement:

The Ellume COVID-19 Home Test is available without a prescription for use by people with or without COVID-19 symptoms. This at-home test uses swab samples taken from further up inside the nose (mid-turbinate) but not as deep inside the nose to reach the back of the throat (nasopharyngeal) where a health care professional collects a sample. The Ellume COVID-19 Home Test uses an analyzer that connects with a smartphone app to show users how to perform the test and understand the test results.

Ellume is recalling specific lots of the coronavirus tests because they had a higher-than-acceptable false positive results for the coronavirus, the agency continued, adding “The reliability of negative test results is not affected.”

In regard to the tests, a false positive result showed an individual had the virus when they did not have it.

This could lead to delayed diagnosis or treatment for the actual cause of the person’s sickness, further spread of the virus, or the individual receiving unnecessary coronavirus treatment from health care professionals.

“There have been 35 reports of false positive results sent to the FDA and no deaths reported,” the agency said.

In October, Ellume recalled some at-home tests when it learned they reported a higher-than-expected rate of false positive results.

“The company said about 427,000 tests are in the lots identified in the recall, and nearly 200,000 are unused. Ellume said tests from those lots may provide false positive results at a rate higher than researchers saw during clinical testing,” the Associated Press (AP) reported at the time."

“Empirically, we find no evidence that school closures in Japan caused a significant reduction in the number of coronavirus cases,” the study’s authors wrote.

“These null results concerning the supposed benefits of closing schools suggest that policymakers should be cautious when considering similar policies in the future, especially given the substantial costs such policies can have for the well-being of both children and parents,” the study warned.

A team of researchers from Gakushuin University in Tokyo, Shizuoka University in Shizuoka, and Harvard University in Massachusetts studied the effects of school shutdowns across 847 municipalities in Japan starting on March 2, 2020. The study included data from 27 of Japan’s 47 total prefectures.

“To estimate the causal effects strictly in Japan in spring 2020, we compared the number of cases between municipalities with open schools and municipalities with closed schools,” the study’s authors wrote.

The researchers said they selected both municipalities with shuttered schools and those with open schools “so that they are similar in terms of dozens of features (for example, past number of cases; social, economic and political factors; and NPIs [national public initiatives] other than school closures such as stay-at-home warnings and business closures).”

The study examined the number of new coronavirus cases per 100,000 residents in both types of municipalities from March 4 to June 1, 2020.

“[W]e did not find any evidence that school closures significantly decreased the spread of COVID-19,” the authors wrote.

“Our results suggest that the effect of school closures on COVID-19 cases in Japan in early 2020 is not significantly different from zero,” the researchers stated.

“Our null results suggest that policies on school closures should be reexamined given the potential negative consequences for children and parents,” the study added.

Japan’s government has ruled out shutting down the country’s public schools to curb the spread of coronavirus moving forward.

“The government will not seek such blanket school closures,” Japanese Education Minister Hagiuda Koichi told reporters at a news conference on August 20, noting that he referred to elementary, middle, and high schools.

“We will protect children’s opportunities for learning as much as possible,” the education minister added."

White went on to say that Americans should have autonomy over their bodies.

“I believe as an American, that’s your choice. If you want to get vaccinated — your body. This is a free country. You do what you want,” he said.

However, despite his feelings and his desire to let fighters make their own decisions about vaccinations, White has scheduled an event to be held in New York City’s Madison Square Garden — in a state that requires vaccinations both for performers and athletes and their fans.

White explained that away saying that fans who are unvaccinated will have plenty of other UFC events to attend if they don’t want to go to New York City.

Ruhle said, “Nobody knows exactly when they’re going down, but you have to put all this in perspective. This inflation is not in isolation, and the government predicted it was going to be a challenging recovery, recovery all tied to Covid. So it’s why you see things like that expanded child tax credit. You’ve got the families of over 60 million kids, on average, getting $430 a month. For people on fixed incomes, older people on social security, they’re getting those fixed payments adjusted next year up 5.9% for inflation.”

She continued, “And the dirty little secret here, while nobody likes to pay more, on average we have the money to do so. Household savings hit a record high over the pandemic. We didn’t really have anywhere to go out and spend. And as we said a moment ago, we’re expecting retail sales this holiday season to break records. For those who own their homes, the value of our homes are up. While the stock market isn’t the economy, you have over half of American households with some investment in the markets and they hit market highs.”

Ruhle added, “So we need to put all of this in perspective. This time last year when you and I were talking nobody had a vaccine. Now 200 million Americans do, and we’re seeing this push of demand and that’s pushing up pricing.”

The survey asked respondents,” Do you approve or disapprove of the way Joe Biden is handling COVID-19?”

His approval on the coronavirus is currently underwater, as 44 percent approve and 46 disapprove — a net negative rating of two percent.

Of those who disapprove 34 percent “strongly” disapprove, while 22 percent “strongly” approve.

A majority of independents, 51 percent, disapprove of his handling of the coronavirus, and of those, 40 percent “strongly” disapprove. Eighty-one percent of Republicans disapprove, while 81 percent of Democrats approve.

While Biden’s general approval rating has dropped across the board in recent months, the drop in his handling of the coronavirus is significant, as it suggests Americans are not satisfied with his overreaching edicts and mandates.

In September, Biden announced his decision to direct the Occupational Safety and Public Health (OSHA) to issue an emergency temporary standard (ETS), forcing employers with over 100 employees to implement vaccine mandates or vigorous testing requirements. OSHA released the rule last week, which is slated to take place January 4.

Under the rule, workers who opt for the testing requirement must handle with the cost themselves, as OSHA is not requiring employers to cover it. Additionally, the rule includes “planned inspections” and fines beginning at $14,000 per violation on employers. The rule comes months after the White House made it clear that the vaccine mandates were “not the role of the federal government.”

The survey, taken November 6-9, 2021, among 1,500 U.S. adults, has a margin of error of +/- 3 percent.

More recently, Biden is begging parents to “please” get their children vaccinated following the authorization of Pfizer’s shots for 5- to 11-year-olds."

Health Minister Tells Britons to Get Covid Booster to Avoid Christmas Restrictions https://t.co/PbjReoUT6R — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) November 7, 2021

Last Sunday, Britain’s Health Secretary Sajid Javid put out a press release stating that Britons needed to get booster doses of the vaccine in order to avoid restrictions at Christmas time.

“This truly is a national mission. If we all come together and play our part, we can get through this challenging winter, avoid a return to restrictions and enjoy Christmas,” Javid said.

In the United States, the head of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, Dr Anthony Fauci, also expressed concern over Christmas gatherings last month, saying it was “too soon to tell” whether Americans would be able to get together for the holidays.

“We have to concentrate on continuing to get those numbers down and not try to jump ahead by weeks or months and say what we’re going to do at a particular time. Let’s focus like a laser on continuing to get those cases down. And we can do it by people getting vaccinated,” Fauci said.

After months of battles, every school district defying the administration, including Broward, Alachua Broward, and Miami-Dade counties, have dropped their mandatory masking requirement for students after the Florida Department of Education “voted to withhold funding from after they imposed strict mask mandates despite a state order prohibiting them,” as Forbes reported:

The Florida Department of Education has not yet responded to a request for comment on whether funding will be restored to the Florida school districts now that their mask orders are lifted. The state has been withholding an amount of funds every month equivalent to the school board members’ salaries and any federal grants the district receives for their Covid-19 measures.

Indeed, Miami-Dade is among the latest to drop the requirement, allowing parents to fill out a form to opt their children out of mandatory mask wearing in school:

However, Miami-Dade Public Schools’ website emphasizes that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) “continues to recommend universal masking in schools, regardless of vaccination status.”

DeSantis has long maintained that forced masking in schools would not be tolerated in the Sunshine State, contending there is “not very much science” behind the practice.

“We want kids to be able to be kids,” he explained during a news conference at Indian River State College in Fort Pierce, Florida, in July. “We need them to be able to breathe. It’s terribly uncomfortable for them to do it. There’s not very much science behind it.”

“I think it’s really important that — parents can obviously equip their kid to go to school however they want, but there shouldn’t be any coercive mandates on our schools,” he continued.

“Obviously people can — parents can make decisions how they want to, we wouldn’t restrict that, but we certainly will not have any mandates on students and on parents in the upcoming school year,” the Republican governor added, sticking to his position throughout the school year."

“Stash houses are a threat to national security and a threat to the people in our communities not only due to the criminal activity they are linked to but also because of the lack of sanitary conditions which can foster a breeding ground for illnesses or other communicable diseases,” Laredo Sector officials said in a written statement.

He also said officials will not set up state-run vaccination sites similar to the ones opened at the beginning of the year for adults, WFLA reported.

“The vaccines are going to everybody in the normal medical system the way it is,” DeSantis explained. “So we’re not doing vaccine sites. They’re at the pharmacies. They’re readily available for everybody.”

“I don’t think there’s any difference in the vaccine that’s doing,” he continued. “I think they may take a lower dosage. So there’s no shortage of availability of any of that. But it’s not something that the state is administering at this point. We basically got it through the whole economy in April. So it’s been available at every drug store since then.”

During the press conference at Cecil Field in Duval County, the governor said the decision to vaccinate a child for the coronavirus was a parent’s decision.

“It’s already not lawful to mandate the COVID vaccine for young children, and we’re gonna make sure that that is enforced and that parents are the ones that can make these key decisions for their children and for their future,” he noted.

U.S. health officials on Tuesday gave final clearance to Pfizer’s child-size coronavirus shot, the Associated Press (AP) reported.

“The Food and Drug Administration already authorized the shots for children ages 5 to 11 — doses just a third of the amount given to teens and adults. But the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention formally recommends who should receive FDA-cleared vaccines,” the outlet said.

Meanwhile, DeSantis has made it clear he will do everything he can to stop the federal government from forcing Florida residents to choose to either receive the coronavirus vaccine or lose their jobs.

It was established by Congress in 1926, to honor Americans who fought in World War One, which came to a victorious end with the armistice of November 11, 1918. In a White House proclamation, President Calvin Coolidge described the conflict, then known as the Great War, as “the most destructive, sanguinary, and far-reaching war in human annals.”

Yet a few years later came an even greater and more destructive war, World War Two, and soon thereafter, a smaller war in Korea. So in 1954, Congress renamed Armistice Day, by now a federal holiday, as Veterans Day to honor all veterans who served in peacetime or in wartime.

Later that year, President Dwight D. Eisenhower—himself, of course, a veteran of legend—issued a statement declaring that the whole nation should honor its vets: “To insure proper and widespread observance of this anniversary, all veterans, all veterans’ organizations, and the entire citizenry will wish to join hands in common purpose.”

Join hands in common purpose. A noble goal for Americans, and yet in these polarized times, that goal might seem to be a little bit aspirational. Sadly, these days, not everyone is on board with patriotic devotion and ceremony.

For instance, there’s the city of Austin—a hyper-liberal blue dot inside red Texas—which recently forced the cancellation of a planned Veterans Day parade. Why? The stated reason was that parade organizers were not in compliance with the city’s Covid-19 restrictions, which bespeak Austin’s continuing blue nanny-state orientation.

According to the Austin Veteran Parade Foundation, the city was demanding that parade organizers “verify all participants and spectators to have either a current negative Covid test or be vaccinated.” As the organizers explained, “This is something that we could not do, as we anticipated some 30,000 attendees to the parade.”

Regular Breitbart News readers won’t be surprised to learn that a left-wing place such as Austin has been imposing a double standard on outdoor activity. Last year, as Black Lives Matter protests erupted in Austin, city leaders took a relaxed view of the mass gatherings. Authorities never worried about permits for the demonstrations, let alone whether or not the protestors—some of them, of course, violent rioters—were wearing masks or practicing social distancing.

In fact, just last month there was a massive pro-abortion march and rally in Austin, including an outdoor concert, all without much social distancing. To put it mildly, it certainly must have been challenging for the left-wing organizers to confirm that everyone present was vaccinated or showed a negative Covid test, assuming that such protocols were required of them at all.

In addition to left-wing protests, Austin continues to favor other activities that it deems acceptable, while disfavoring those it finds unacceptable. Thus the Austin FC soccer team has been playing regularly, selling out the 20,000-seat Q2 Stadium. Even in the midst of the pandemic, seats are snapped up in seconds.

Does the city worry about whether these soccer fans are all tested and vaccinated? Of course not!

In fact, Austin is so left-wing that it continues to undermine the police. Whereas pro-police ballot efforts succeeded this year in such liberal towns as Minneapolis and Seattle, a pro-cop effort in Austin was defeated, by more than 2:1.

So if Austinites don’t like their own police, what chance did our veterans have?

To be sure, one resident of Austin fought to keep the parade within city limits. That would be Governor Greg Abbott, who offered the parade organizers the use of the grounds of the state capitol. Sadly, that alternative plan fell through.

However, other patriotic ceremonies were able to continued in Austin, such as the placing of American flags on each grave at the Texas State Cemetery. And without a doubt, across Texas—as well as across the nation—we’ll see plenty of proper honoring of veterans.

Yet still, the Austin experience should tell us something. It should make us realize that important civic rituals are not always spontaneous. That is, someone has to plan for them—just as Congress did back in 1926—and someone has to organize them and work to keep them alive.

Back in 1954, President Eisenhower took the November 11 holiday so seriously that he formally designated the head of the Veterans Administration to chair a Veterans Day National Committee. As the 34th president wrote, “I am requesting the heads of all departments and agencies of the Executive branch of the Government to assist the Committee in its work in every way possible.”

In fact, planning for important national holidays goes back to the beginning of the republic in 1776—to the Fourth of July. As John Adams, the future second president, wrote in a letter to his wife Abigail of the new holiday:

I am apt to believe that it will be celebrated, by succeeding Generations, as the great anniversary Festival. It ought to be commemorated, as the Day of Deliverance by solemn Acts of Devotion to God Almighty. It ought to be solemnized with Pomp and Parade, with Shews, Games, Sports, Guns, Bells, Bonfires and Illuminations from one End of this Continent to the other from this Time forward forever more.

Thus the lesson: Leave nothing to chance.

Another American caught up in that same spirit of consciously shaping patriots was Noah Webster. These days, Webster is best known for his dictionary, and yet back in 1785 he published a school textbook, An American Selection of Lessons in Reading and Speaking, featuring patriotic writings and speeches from George Washington and other heroes. The book enjoyed some 77 printings over the next few decades; in some editions, the title page featured this quote on the importance of educating the young to be patriots: “Begin with the infant in the cradle; let the first word he lisps be Washington.”

Yes, today, we must actively teach the young to be good patriots; if we fail to do so, they could end up like too many in Austin.

Indeed, strong patriotic education isn’t just a nice thing; it’s an essential thing. As Winston Churchill—whose mother was an American—declared of patriotic public instruction, “A love for tradition has never weakened a nation, indeed it has strengthened nations in their hour of peril.” Churchill said those words in 1944, during the middle of World War Two. In that war, as in every war, we are reminded that we need the bravery and the sacrifice that comes from patriots.

And speaking of 1944, the year of D-Day, we might recall that the opening scene of the film Saving Private Ryan—before the hellish scenes of the bloody landing at Omaha Beach—starts with an American flag.

So who, today, will teach Americans about patriotism? About the true meaning of Veterans Day? We know all too well what the other side is doing; we know, for instance, about The New York Times’ dishonest and divisive 1619 Project, which has now worked its way into many school curricula, where it has joined with Critical Race Theory.

Fortunately, the voters are rejecting CRT, as they did in Virginia earlier this month. And yet we must do more than just say “no” to bad lessons; we must say “yes” to good lessons. We need a better, brighter vision. So where can we look? To whom?

One such aid is the work of William Damon, a professor of education at Stanford and a fellow at the conservative Hoover Institution. Last year, he authored How to Educate an American: The Conservative Vision for Tomorrow’s School, which includes this pertinent point:

Unfortunately, patriotism is not a popular word in education circles. In fact, patriotism is one of the most politically incorrect words in education today. If you think it’s hard to talk about morality and values in schools, try talking about patriotism.

Damon adds:

To acquire civic purpose, students need to care about their country. As a foundation for citizenship education, schools should begin with the positive and emphasize reasons for caring enough about our society to participate in it and try to improve it. In this way, American students and those who teach them can share civic purposes energized by a motivating spirit of patriotism.

If we were to follow Damon’s example—and the guidance of others who share his views—we’d have schoolbooks that give young Americans “civic purpose” and a “motivating spirit of patriotism.” And if the young gain those positive traits, we’d have Americans who, when duty calls, will go rushing to defend the flag and the republic for which it stands.

And so we come back to Veterans Day. We owe the soldiers of the past for their brave and stalwart service. And yet as we look ahead to an inevitably stormy future—sadly, we haven’t seen the last war—we realize that paying our debt to the past is actually the best investment we can make for a secure future.

Because is the soldier who keeps us free."

Set to the tune of Queen’s Don’t Stop Me Now, the Tesco Christmas ad features a hyper-diverse cast of characters rushing around to make preparations for the Christian holiday.

At one point the festivities are interrupted by a “Breaking News” announcement warning that “Santa could be quarantined”, but the crisis is averted and Christmas is saved when Santa Claus presents a vaccine passport to border officials, spurring raucous applause.

“This Christmas, nothing’s stopping us,” the advertisement proclaims.

Explaining the rationale behind the marketing campaign, Tesco’s Chief Customer Officer, Alessandra Bellini, said that the company’s research found that the British public “won’t let anything stop them” from celebrating Christmas this year.

“This got us thinking about all the little things that have the potential to get in our way — from running out of mince pies to running late to a Christmas party — and the nation’s determined spirit that ensures we’ll overcome them all.

“We hope our joyful festive ad will resonate and put a smile on people’s faces as we prepare for a season of well-deserved celebrations. Afterall, this Christmas, nothing’s stopping us.”

Health Minister Tells Britons to Get Covid Booster to Avoid Christmas Restrictions https://t.co/PbjReoUT6R — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) November 7, 2021

The ad may be a touch hopeful, however, as government ministers have suggested that another Christmas lockdown could be on the cards if vaccine booster shot uptake is not to its liking.

Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s government promised last year that it would ease lockdown restrictions for the holiday, yet ultimately caved to pressure and kept restrictions in place throughout much of England during Christmas.

Tesco’s treatment of Father Christmas was perhaps not as harsh as an advertisement from Britain’s socialised healthcare system last year, however, in which he was seen lying on a hospital bed struggling to breathe, presumably after contracting the Wuhan virus.

Just over one year ago, Breitbart London also captured Metropolitan Police officers threatening to arrest a Santa impersonator for violating lockdown restrictions while standing in Trafalgar Square during an anti-lockdown demonstration.

The ad begins with an unconscious Father Christmas being rushed through a hospital corridor on oxygen while one of the clinicians around him — fully kitted out in masks and face shields — asks “Is he responding?” https://t.co/vjfXDlS4hU — Breitbart News (@BreitbartNews) December 12, 2020

The Tesco Christmas advert, which features a slew of multi-ethnic families celebrating Christmas, does fall in line with the trend on British television screens of portraying an exaggeratedly multicultural cross-section of British society.

Tesco has previously drawn criticism for a 2017 Christmas advertisement that failed to include any visibly Christian characters or Christian symbols, while at the same time featuring people in Muslim garb, Sikhs, and a pair of homosexual dads.

Last week, Rodgers appeared on McAfee’s show and in a long interview explained that he is allergic to ingredients in some of the coronavirus mRNA vaccines, and so he was pursuing alternative methods of avoiding infection.

Rodgers started his interview acknowledging that he was “in the crosshairs of the work mob.”

Apparently, Rodgers felt that should have put an end to the swirling questions over his vaccine status. Instead, the media — and especially the left-wing sports media — intensified its attacks on him instead of accepting his explanation and moving on to other sports news. The “woke mob” only got louder, and Rodgers is perplexed, according to People magazine.

Rodgers is reportedly “upset” that he is still being slandered by the media, and “feels like he just shared his point of view, and now he’s being crucified for it.”

“He knew some people would disagree with him, but he didn’t know that it would become the s–tstorm it became. People who he thought were friends are turning on him,” People reported. “He’s very unhappy with the response to him.”

Rodgers also lost a sponsor due to his ideas about the vaccine. The quarterback was dropped as a spokesman by Prevea Health, a Wisconsin medical care system.

However, another big sponsor, State Farm Insurance, came out backing Rodgers’ right to have an opinion and said it would not drop him as a spokesman.

“Aaron Rodgers has been a great ambassador for our company for much of the past decade,” State Farm said on Monday. “We don’t support some of the statements that he has made, but we respect his right to have his own personal point of view. We recognize our customers, employees, agents and brand ambassadors come from all walks of life, with differing viewpoints on many issues. Our mission at State Farm is to support safer, stronger communities. To that end, we encourage vaccinations, but respect everyone’s right to make a choice based on their personal circumstances.”

Rodgers missed last Sunday’s game against the Chiefs because he tested positive for the virus and is on a ten-day, league COVID protocol. If he tests negative through this week, he will be eligible to return to the field for next Sunday’s game.

Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker’s (D) statewide mask mandate, which he announced in August, has no signs of ending as the holidays approach, despite the Democrat governor’s previous desire to “remove the mitigations as we approach the holidays.” However, with cases spiking in the state, IDPH Director Ezike is casting doubts on that timeline.

“As we’ve moved indoors, we haven’t maybe taken our masks indoors with us. So a lot of unmasked indoor gatherings are likely part of the problem,” Ezike said, according to WGEM. “Of course, COVID is so complicated. It’s been throwing us curveball after curveball.”

“We’d like to do everything we can (by) vaccinating, getting boosted, wearing our masks, you know encouraging other people to get vaccinated. All of that will help decrease these horrible statistics that we keep reporting and watching every day,” Ezike added.

The current mandate applies to those ages two and older, regardless of vaccination status.

Notably, the masked-up state is experiencing a spike in the coronavirus, experiencing one of the highest 14-day increases of coronavirus cases in the United States — +49 percent in the last two weeks alone.

Further, this week, the state topped 5,000 new cases of the virus for the first time in the last two months.

Chicago Public Health Commissioner Dr. Allison Arwady said the answer is mass vaccination.

“For me, it’s especially an indication that now is the time to get vaccinated if you haven’t yet, and to make sure your kids are getting vaccinated,” Arwady said Tuesday.

“If we can get a lot of students vaccinated now, if we can get a lot of adults vaccinated and boosted ahead of the holidays, right now is the time to do that,” she added. “We wait a month, we wait two months — we could be in the middle of a larger surge.”

According to the New York Times’ coronavirus case tracker, last updated Thursday, Illinois is reporting a daily average of 3,112 cases, or 25 per 100,000. Meanwhile, mask-free states, particularly Florida, which never had a statewide mask mandate in place at any point during the pandemic, are reporting decreases in case counts in the same time frame. According to the Times’ data, Florida is tied with Hawaii for the lowest daily average of coronavirus cases per capita, standing at seven. Overall, the Sunshine State is reporting a daily average of 1,423 cases, representing a 19 percent decrease over the last two weeks."

Radio Free Europe (RFE) cited Iranian state television reports that demonstrations were held in 800 cities across Iran. The rally in Tehran featured an address from Gen. Hossein Salami, commander of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), a designated terrorist organization.

Salami delivered a speech about the evils of U.S. imperialism while an oversized American flag was “spread on the street so protesters could stomp on it,” as RFE put it. American and Israeli flags were burned at other rallies amid chants of “Death to America” and “Death to Israel.”

Salami claimed the U.S. has “used all means, policies, and strategies to surrender the Iranian nation,” but despite these efforts, “the Islamic Republic has become stronger.” The sizable number of Iranians who have been protesting against their government’s mismanagement of the economy, education, and the coronavirus pandemic might disagree.

A statement from the Iranian government restated its support for Palestinian, Lebanese, and Yemeni terrorist movements, along with Iran’s proxy forces in Iraq and Syria, and the restless Shiites of Bahrain.

Tehran saluted all of these movements as fellow soldiers in the “powerful army of the Islamic Ummah” fighting against the “system of global domination and Zionism” perpetuated by the United States, Israel, and their allies. The November 4 statement also condemned Muslim nations that normalized relations with Israel during former President Donald Trump’s Abraham Accords initiative.

Iran’s PressTV noted that November 4 is known as “National Day of the Fight Against Global Arrogance” and “National Student Day,” a nod to the student “activists” who overran the U.S. Embassy in 1979.

November 4 is also marked on Iranian regime calendars as the day the godfather of the Islamic revolution, Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, was exiled to Turkey in 1964, and the day of a 1978 Islamist student protest that was brutally suppressed by the Shah of Iran.

“Last year’s events were canceled due to an increase in COVID-19 [Chinese coronavirus] infections, this year’s events are being held across the nation while people observe health protocols,” PressTV said.

As RFE pointed out, Iran’s vicious November 4 celebrations were held the day after Iran agreed to renewed nuclear negotiations with the United States and European Union.

Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi gave a defiant address on state television on Thursday in which he pledged to “stand against excessive demands which could damage our nation’s interests.”

Raisi said he would not budge from Iran’s demand for unilateral and unconditional “lifting of all U.S. sanctions and neutralization of sanctions.”

“The negotiations we are considering are result-oriented ones. We will not leave the negotiating table… but we will not retreat from the interests of our nation in any way,” he declared.

Iran’s chief negotiator, Deputy Foreign Minister Ali Bagheri Kani, made the same point on Wednesday when agreeing to restart “the negotiations aiming at removal of unlawful and inhumane sanctions on 29 November in Vienna.”

“We believe it remains possible to quickly reach and implement an understanding on a mutual return to compliance with the JCPOA by closing the relatively small number of issues that remained outstanding at the end of June when the sixth round concluded,” the Biden State Department responded."

In the early days of the pandemic, China was vociferously opposed to travel bans and was fond of citing the World Health Organization’s (W.H.O.) opposition to support its position. China accused the United States of “manufacturing and spreading panic” by calling for restrictions on Chinese travel.

Once the coronavirus pushed beyond China’s borders, Beijing abruptly changed its tune, tightly restricting international travel and blaming foreign visitors for every new coronavirus outbreak in China.

Chinese health officials blame the current outbreak of Chinese coronavirus, which has spread across 20 provinces, on a tour group of senior citizens from Shanghai. Last week, Chinese officials speculated the disease might have originated in India and spread through Mongolia to reach Shanghai, but have provided no evidence to substantiate these claims

The Global Times fumed that America is ending its pandemic travel bans after almost two years while “infections have been increasing again in Europe, given the colder temperatures and the fading of vaccine-induced immunity.”

What really irked the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) paper is that Western media has “cast doubts on China’s zero-tolerance policy to handle the epidemic” and refuses to acknowledge the tremendous benefits China supposedly enjoyed from its lockdowns:

Some epidemiologists told the Global Times that China has gained huge benefits in insisting on this approach including public health benefits, economic recovery and employment, and it’s not yet the right time to change the approach. “We can’t abandon the zero-tolerance now, as given the global pandemic situation, changing our epidemic prevention policies and lifting strict controls would lead to a catastrophic outcome,” a senior public health expert close to the National Health Commission (NHC) told the Global Times on condition of anonymity in a recent interview. Considering the overall health system situation, lifting the anti-epidemic measures means a sudden increase in infections, which will deliver a heavy blow to the health system and the country’s economic and social development, the expert said, noting that as there is a regional imbalance, abandoning the current approach will lead to significant consequences.

“Some Chinese epidemiologists believe that it’s still not time for Western countries like the US to lower border restrictions, although those countries made their decision based on the vaccination speed, but they fail to take other factors such as winter and the Delta variant into account,” the Global Times warned.

Editor-in-chief Hu Xijin sneered on Tuesday that America is adopting a “money over life” attitude and embracing “social Darwinism,” which left-wingers view as an insult meaning “improve society by killing off the weak.”

Hu predicted China’s “zero-Covid policy” will allow it to eventually “reopen borders at lower cost.”

“We adhere to humanitarianism, but a dynamic zero-case policy should be economically effective in the future, with advantages outweighing that of a full lifting of a travel ban, to be sustainable in the long run,” he advised.

SARS expert Guan Yi, currently director of the State Key Laboratory of Emerging Infectious Diseases at China’s Shantou University, disagreed in an interview cited by South China Morning Post (SCMP) on Tuesday.

Guan endorsed the American approach, arguing that “building a shield of protection using vaccines” and learning to cope with a virus that has “a foothold in mankind” is more logical than employing extreme measures in an impossible quest to eliminate it.

“Local governments are adopting zero tolerance to these scattered cases, but if that remains the case, I think our economy will collapse,” Guan warned.

Guan noted that during the SARS outbreak of 2002-2003, he was able to identify the intermediate animal host that was spreading the disease and contain it before it could become fully adapted to humans.

On the other hand, despite two years of intense effort, no one has been able to identify the animal intermediary that could have spread Chinese coronavirus to humans, and the virus fully adapted to humans with incredible speed – two facts that lead a growing number of analysts to believe the virus emerged from a Chinese laboratory instead of spreading through nature. Guan himself predicted early in 2020 that the Chinese coronavirus would be far more difficult to contain than SARS."

On Tue… [+4815 chars]",Right,"The Biden Department of Labor (DOL) proposed rescinding a Trump administration rule that protects the religious liberty of faith-based organizations that contract with the federal government.

On Tuesday the DOL said it would roll back the Trump rule that went into effect on January 8 and allows religious groups that are federal contractors to specifically hire people who hold to their faith beliefs.

In August 2019, the Trump Labor Department announced the proposed rule intended to clarify that faith-based organizations “may make employment decisions consistent with their sincerely held religious tenets and beliefs without fear of sanction by the federal government.”

The Biden administration signaled it intended to overturn the rule, however, after civil rights organizations claimed it allowed discrimination against LGBTQ individuals in terms of hiring by faith-based groups.

The Biden administration is claiming the Trump rule “departed from” the Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs’ (OFCCP) “longstanding policy and practice of applying principles and case law to interpret the exemption.”

Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs Director Jenny R. Yang claimed:

The Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs’ proposed rescission would protect against discrimination and safeguard principles of religious freedom. With this proposal, OFCCP would simply return to our policy and practice of considering the facts of each case and applying Title VII principles and case law and other applicable law.

But, Mary Beth Waddell, Family Research Council’s director of Federal Affairs for Family and Religious Liberty, said the Biden administration is actually “couching its change in terms of following precedent and the law to promote religious freedom,” and “doing the opposite.”

Waddell said in a statement sent to Breitbart News:

This Department of Labor proposed rule curtails the ability of religious individuals and entities to live out their faith in the public square. This is one of many choices the Biden administration has made to sideline religious freedom and elevate other policies in its place.

“Religious freedom must protect the ability to practice and exercise sincerely held religious beliefs in the public square,” she added. Waddell noted the Trump administration:

…understood this and did not tamper with what constituted a religious exemption in this rule, but rather defined the terms and added a rule of construction in favor of the broadest protection of religious exercise ‘permitted by the U.S. Constitution and law.’

Waddell explained that, under the Trump-era rule, “religion” was defined as including “all aspects of religious observance and practice, as well as belief.” She went on:

The Biden administration’s move away from this definition is bad news. Faith-based entities should not be denied government contracts and grants just because they want their employees to follow the same faith tenets they do. They should be allowed to freely exercise their religious freedom and run their business in accordance with the tenets of their faith.

American Atheists released a statement praising the Biden DOL’s proposed rule as it claimed the administration was “restoring workers’ freedom of religion.”

“The government should never fund businesses that justify discrimination based on religious beliefs,” said Alison Gill, the group’s vice president for legal and policy. “And American taxpayers should never be forced to be complicit in discrimination.”

Nick Fish, president of American Atheists, added, “Finally, atheists, LGBTQ people, women, and religious minorities will see these important protections restored.”

“Let me be clear: The people who will be complaining about this change do not care about religious freedom—they only care about how they can use religion as a weapon against people different from them,” he stated.

But Terry Schilling, president of American Principles Project, said in a statement sent to Breitbart News that the proposed rescission of the Trump-era rule is a sign that “Joe Biden’s anti-American war on our fundamental freedoms continues.”

He elaborated:

The administration is lying when they claim this move will prevent “discrimination.” In fact, it will do the very opposite: by eliminating critical religious liberty protections, the administration is declaring open season on persecuting religious organizations that dare to dissent from the left’s prevailing sexual orthodoxy. This is an affront to the First Amendment, but it shouldn’t surprise anyone — this is who they are. They oppose free speech. They reject the idea of religious freedom. The once great Democratic Party has been reduced to a bunch of would-be totalitarians hellbent on forcing everyone to submit to their insane mandates on gender, critical race theory, or even the latest politicized COVID “science.”

“It’s obviously not going to work,” Schilling said. “Americans are sick and tired of the left’s radicalism, and there will be political hell to pay next November.”"

Defying calls fro… [+4300 chars]",Right,"(AFP) Exhibiting a torture instrument as an innocent rocking chair, Chinese dissident artist Badiucao mocks the propaganda of Beijing in a new show — while appropriating its codes.

Defying calls from the Chinese government to cancel it, the northern Italian city of Brescia is hosting the first international solo exhibition by the 35-year-old artist and exile from China who lives in Australia.

Badiucao’s works are “full of anti-Chinese lies” that “jeopardise the friendly relations between China and Italy”, charged Beijing’s embassy in Rome in a letter sent last month to Brescia’s town hall.

But the city stood its ground.

“None of us in Brescia, neither in the city council nor among the citizens, had the slightest doubt about this exhibition going ahead,” Deputy Mayor Laura Castelletti told AFP.

Brescia, known for its Roman ruins, has a long tradition of welcoming dissidents, painters and writers, in the “defence of artistic freedom”, she said.

The last was in 2019, with the works of Kurdish artist Zehra Dogan, who spent nearly three years in jail in Turkey.

The new show, “China is (not) near — works of a dissident artist”, which opened Friday, denounces political repression in China and the country’s censorship of the origins of the coronavirus, two explosive subjects for Beijing.

The exhibit, whose title is an allusion to a famous Italian film from 1967, “China Is Near”, runs until February 13 at the Santa Giulia museum.

In an interview with AFP, Badiucao — who has been called “the Chinese Banksy” — said he was “very happy and proud” that the city “had the courage to say ‘no’ to China to defend fundamental rights.”

– ‘Death threats’ –

“I want to use my art to expose the lies, to expose the problems of the Chinese government, to criticise the Chinese government, however on the other hand it’s also celebrating the Chinese people, for how brave Chinese people are… even when they have been subjected to this very harsh environment with an authoritarian government,” Badiucao said, speaking in English.

Plans for a Hong Kong show in 2018 fell through after pressure on the artist and his entourage, said the bespectacled Badiucao, who sports a long, shaggy beard.

“The national security police went to intimidate my family in Shanghai,” he said, adding they threatened to “send officers” to the opening if the exhibit were held.

Among the works exhibited in Brescia that have provoked the ire of Beijing is a famous image of Chinese President Xi Jinping merged with the face of Carrie Lam, Hong Kong’s chief executive, to illustrate the erosion of self-rule in the former British colony.

The Chinese Communist Party “thinks that all free artists are its enemies, that’s why it hates me so much,” said Badiucao, who added that he receives “daily death threats” on social media.

Due to heavy censorship, he said he only learned decades later as a university student studying law in China about the government’s brutal 1989 crackdown on protesters in Tiananmen Square.

He decided to dedicate himself to art, moving to Australia in 2009 and only revealing his identity publically on its 30th anniversary a decade later.

Another of his works depicts 64 watches painted with the artist’s own blood, representing those given to Chinese soldiers, according to Badiucao, as a reward for their participation in the bloody Tiananmen Square crackdown.

The exhibition also pays tribute to “Tank Man”, the unknown man wearing a white shirt and carrying two plastic shopping bags who stood up to advancing tanks.

In a nod to current events, the tanks remodelled by Badiucao are topped by balls resembling the Covid-19 virus under a microscope.

– Sidestepping censors –

Hung on one of the museum’s walls are pages from a diary of a resident of Wuhan, epicentre of the pandemic, who managed to circumvent the censorship to recount his daily life at the start of the confinement.

The dissident said there is no doubt Beijing is responsible for the pandemic, alleging that it failed to heed warnings over the coronavirus’ first appearance in Wuhan in late 2019.

The exhibition “has no intention of offending the Chinese people or Chinese culture and civilisation”, the president of the Brescia Museums Foundation, Francesca Bazoli, said.

In showing these works, she added, “we support freedom of expression”."

Greg Abbott (R-TX) is a fighter. Whether it’s surviving a near-fatal accident that left him paralyzed or leading his state through the coronavirus pandemic, Abbott isn’t afraid of adversity, and he has faced plenty of it from the “Brandon” administration. In spite of President Joe Biden’s open-border policies, anti-drilling agenda, and vaccine authoritarianism, Abbott told Breitbart News that Texas is and remains America’s “Opportunity State.”

On a windy afternoon in mid-October at the University of Texas’s football stadium, Abbott – the 48th and current governor of Texas – sat at the fifty-yard line for a broad exclusive interview with Breitbart News’ On the Hill video series. During the interview, Abbott pitched himself as the counterbalance to President Biden’s “disastrous policies” and federal overreach — things so often seen when the Democrats hold power. It’s a role with which he is very familiar. As Texas attorney general, Abbott sued the Obama administration 27 times. Since Biden took office, Abbott has continued to push back against Democrats, including being one of the first governors to fully re-open his state for business and terminate mask mandates. Abbott also is leading the way against Biden’s vaccine mandate for American businesses, issuing an executive order banning any entity in Texas — including those privately owned — from mandating coronavirus vaccines.

Up for re-election next year, the two-term governor navigates a noticeable political tightrope between the demands of conservative and moderate Texans. The past 19 months have delivered some of his biggest challenges in office to date. But, overcoming challenges is Greg Abbott’s brand, so to speak.

In 1984, at the age of 26, the former track star was nearly killed in a horrific accident while jogging with a friend in Houston. An afternoon run — a break from studying for the bar exam — left the recent law school graduate paralyzed from the waist down. As described in a 2013 Texas Monthly profile:

Abbott heard what he describes as a “loud explosion, like a bomb going off.” He had been running a few yards ahead of Frost [his friend], and the next thing he knew, he was down on the ground, having been struck by an oak tree that had snapped near its base. “It hit me in the back and knocked me down,” Abbott says. “It broke bones in my vertebrae, which pierced my spinal cord. I had fractured ribs, which poked into some of my organs. The pain was incomprehensible.”

Abbott told Breitbart News, “I was left with a broken back, a paraplegic never able to walk again.”

“I could have given up on life,” he continued, “but I chose not to do that. I chose to respond to it in ways that would put me on a pathway to go on and become governor of this great state.”

After vowing to never allow his disability to hold him back, Abbott went on to be a successful attorney, district judge, and justice on the Texas Supreme Court. Prior to becoming governor, his tenure as Texas attorney general was the longest in state history.

This determination has defined Abbott’s career – with the word “perseverance” often used in crafting his political image.

When asked if his own life lessons could be applied to Texas and its challenges today, Abbott answered, “What happened in my life, it is a lesson that everybody either does, or should apply every day, a lesson that even football teams on this field should apply. And that is: our lives are not defined by our challenges, but the way that we respond to our challenges.”

“Just because you have a challenge in life,” he said, “just because something goes wrong — even if it’s a catastrophic injury — do not let it be a setback for you. Find a way to move forward.”

The Number One Issue

While Americans are facing challenges on almost all fronts, Abbott freely admits that the Southern Border crisis is “the number one issue” for his constituents.

Shortly before this interview, the humanitarian crisis in Del Rio, Texas, was taking place, which, at its height, saw roughly 15,000 Haitian migrants camped under and around a bridge near the U.S. border. Many of Abbott’s critics were sounding off, concluding that he wasn’t doing enough to seal the border. “Why isn’t he using the National Guard?” and “Why wasn’t he detaining illegal aliens as they crossed the border?” were oft-heard questions.

Well, it turns out Abbott was doing both — perhaps not to the extent his critics would have liked or outside legal constraints — but, make no mistake, Texas, not the Biden Administration, is now doing the lion’s share of work at the Southern Border to address the “catastrophe,” as Abbott calls it, “caused by Joe Biden’s open border policies.”

“Texas is having to shoulder the responsibility that typically is the federal government’s responsibility to secure our border and to secure our sovereignty,” Abbott explained.

“Ever since I’ve been governor, every legislative session we’ve had, we put in close to a billion dollars to deploy resources and personnel to the border to help secure the border,” he continued. “We’re doing more than all the other states have ever done combined.”

The governor went on to explain in detail many of the actions he has taken:

I just signed two bills that provide $3 billion of Texas funds to secure the border. We have thousands of National Guard, well over a thousand Texas Department of Public Safety Officers, [and] Texas Parks and Wildlife game wardens and officials down there, because part of the region is water and they help secure the water portion of the border. On top of all that, we came up with a new plan to arrest and jail people coming across the border for violations of trespass laws, which have accelerated crimes now — or penalties now. And then, Texas is building our own wall on the border, and we’ve already begun that process. On top of that, I’ve signed laws such as making it easier to prosecute smuggling… I signed nine laws, cracking down on the heinous crime of human trafficking. We created a new crime in the state of Texas that goes directly after the drug cartels. It’s a new law for this deadly drug fentanyl, where it’s now a crime to manufacturer or distribute fentanyl in the state of Texas. And then, on top of all of that, we’ve been in court challenging the Biden administration. We got a federal court ruling here in the state of Texas from a federal judge mandating that the Biden administration reinstate the Remain in Mexico policy. It was announced earlier today that the Biden administration is going to go along with that federal judge order and begin the process of re-emphasizing the Remain in Mexico policy.

“The fact is, Texas is stepping up and doing what needs to be done to secure the border,” he said, “[We’re] pretty much the only force responding to the people coming across the border.”

Abbott confirmed at the end of October that he deployed 6,500 National Guardsmen to the border. Some of his detractors, though, continue to insist that more must be done.

Don Huffines, who is a long shot to defeat Abbott in the primary, vows that he would secure the state’s border by putting economic pressure on Mexico and deploying the entire Texas National Guard, some 20,000 members.

“Counterbalance”

In addition to his actions to secure the border where Biden has failed, Abbott’s resolute stance against the Democrat’s agenda has made recurring headlines.

Other actions drawing ire from the Establishment Media include banning critical race theory in classrooms, requiring sports teams receiving state funds to play the national anthem, instituting permitless carry, and banning abortion after six weeks.

Abbott has also defied the so-called experts and Anthony Fauci.

One of the first governors to lift his state’s coronavirus lockdown (May 1, 2020), Abbott, like all politicians, has had to straddle the line between public safety and authoritarianism.

In one of his most recent moves to push back against what he sees as federal overreach, Abbott, who is vaccinated, issued an executive order last month banning any entity, including private businesses, from mandating a coronavirus shot.

“I talked to too many Texans around the entire state, who were literally crying because they faced either losing their job or compromising their own values and safety by getting the vaccine,” he explained to Breitbart News. “One of the catalysts behind my action was to ensure that people would not be losing their jobs.”

Immediately after Abbott issued his executive order, Dallas-based Southwest Airlines and Fort Worth-based American Airlines both said they would be ignoring the governor’s ruling, but Abbott revealed to Breitbart News that “the day after Southwest said they would not comply, they did issue a [statement] saying that no one at Southwest will be terminated … and we have received similar information from American Airlines that may not have been published yet.”

Just days after our interview, Southwest Airlines announced it would be scrapping its plan to place unvaccinated employees with pending exemptions on unpaid leave after a December deadline.

The Texas Republican said he wanted to “set the counterbalance against the Biden administration to say that no one can be compelled to take a vaccine.”

When asked about the legal strategy for keeping his vaccine mandate ban alive given the inevitable challenge from the federal government, Abbott admitted that “this is headed toward a legal showdown,” but he felt “very confident” Texas will win, explaining:

Neither the president of the united states, nor the federal government have any legal authority — any constitutional authority — to issue their vaccine mandate. … [T]hroughout the history of the United States of America, it has been governors in states that have been in charge of health and safety of the people who are residents of those states, not the federal government. So, from the legal side, I feel like we’re on solid ground. Also, from the constitutional side in this regard, and that is part of the governor’s job is to ensure that the freedoms that are guaranteed by the Constitution and laws of our positions are going to be protected.

Although the U.S. Supreme Court has not considered the issue, so far, Abbott’s intuitions have been correct. The fifth circuit issued a stay on Saturday, essentially freezing the mandate, citing “grave statutory and constitutional” issues with the rule.

Abbott’s reference to the lack of constitutional authority for Biden’s mandate is based on long-settled Supreme Court precent that reserves to the individual states the “police power” concerning public health, public safety, personal responsibility, and social welfare, instead of the federal government.

White House press secretary Jen Psaki, however, regarded Abbott’s counter to Biden’s mandate a purely political move. To this charge, Abbott replied that the mandate itself was “politics by the Biden administration.”

“Clearly, they’re acting completely contrary to the Constitution,” the governor continued. “One thing that Biden has failed to do [is] work in collaboration with the states. He had every opportunity to.” Referencing comments from the CEO of Delta Airlines, Abbott said, “A vaccine mandate is a blunt tool that is not needed because there are other effective ways to address this.”



The Texas Dream: “Opportunity and Freedom”

Despite the pandemic, Texas has remained the number one state in the U.S. for economic development. The pandemic lockdowns and their downstream economic consequences have put a bigger spotlight on Texas, the ninth-largest economy in the world if the state were its own country. Abbott often refers to Texas as “the economic engine of America.”

This has led to a massive relocation of Americans in recent years (Texas is, in fact, the only state gaining two congressional seats based on the 2020 Census).

“There are so many people moving to Texas, and most people move to Texas for opportunity and for freedom,” Abbott explained when asked what it meant to be a Texan. “That’s what it means to be a Texan: opportunity and freedom.”

“Maybe the same reason you moved here is the same reason that Elon Musk moved here personally, but also his business,” he continued, adding:

I talked to Elon Musk multiple times before he made that decision, and he talked about those two concepts of freedom and opportunity. You talk to any average Texan about what Texas stands for and its freedom and opportunity, and that is what attracts entrepreneurs here. That could be entrepreneurs that have started businesses, or the entrepreneurs who run these massive, large Fortune 500 companies. It’s the same principle that applies. Texans, from the time that we were in our own country until today, this has been the location of freedom and opportunity.

“Pollsters” and pundits repeatedly assert that any day now, Texas will be blue. While some shifts to the left have occurred (Trump, for instance, only carried the state by 5.5-percentage points in 2020, down from 9-percentage points in 2016), Abbott is “very confident that the people moving here will keep Texas very red.”

“This is something that, as governor, you might imagine I’ve studied very closely,” he said, flashing a big smile. “And the great news is that people who are moving to Texas are making Texas more conservative.” They are leaving states, like California and New York, he explained, where they “cannot stand” the “socialistic policies” anymore.

“They remember why they fled those states, and they want to make sure they do not repeat in Texas what they saw in California or these other crazy leftist states… Every event I go to, there are Californias at those conservative events […] and I know that the people moving from California are making Texas even more red.”

America’s Economic Engine

It’s not just Californians and their companies fleeing to Texas. Abbott wants their cargo ships too.

“Texas ports are open & ready to help fix America’s supply chain backlog,” the governor tweeted last week encouraging log jammed ships to “escape California” and “[c]hoose Texas.”

“We can get goods out faster & at a lower cost than California due to our centralized location,” the tweet continues:

In recent weeks, problems with America’s supply chain have led to empty shelves across America. The hashtags #EmptyShelvesJoe and #BareShelvesBiden have trended online as Americans face shortages and inflation.

As the Biden Administration blames the coronavirus pandemic and, more recently, “online shopping” for the national backlog of goods, experts agree that, while myriad factors are causing the supply chain crisis, two substantially contributing areas are the skyrocketing costs of shipping and warehousing, especially for fuel and chemicals, and the rising energy prices.

Oil recently topped $85 a barrel and is expected to keep climbing into next year. Natural gas prices recently hit their highest point in over a decade.

The White House recently admitted it can’t guarantee Americans will get certain gifts in time for the holiday season.

“We can produce the oil, we can get the supply chain going, we can make things happen in ways that everyone will be able to get their toys by Christmas,” Abbott told Breitbart News. “All they need to do is to leave Texas alone and let us do our thing.”

Texas is by far America’s leader in oil production — producing more than a third of the nation’s product.

The Biden Administration’s decision to reduce oil drilling in the United States in favor of a “green” agenda has cost the United States its energy independence achieved under President Donald Trump. “You’ve seen over the past week at least once, maybe twice, the Biden administration has been kind of asking, if not begging, the Middle East to produce more oil so that the price of energy will go down,” Abbott observed.

Asked whether the Green New Deal is already impacting Americans at the pump specifically, Abbott said “if not directly, definitely indirectly.”

“I’ve talked to the oil and gas producers in [my] state, and they say that one reason why they’re not drilling more is because of inadequate access to capital… [T]he large capital enterprises in New York and some other places, they’re not providing the capital to the drillers to drill more, to produce more,” explained the governor.

For years, leftists have used coercive tactics to fight so-called “climate change.” Today those methods have only become more punitive and include targeting banks that lend to fossil fuel producers in an effort to shut down their money pipeline.

“Getting lenders to choke off money to fossil fuel companies is the next needed move for the industry to address the material risks that the coal, oil and gas industry faces,” Leslie Samuelrich, president at investment advisory firm Green Century Capital Management, told CNBC in April.

“This is simply demand and supply,” Abbott went on. “There is not as much supply as [there] would be if [drillers] were getting the financing, [and] because of that, inadequate supply is driving up the price — and that is part of another flaw in the Biden Administration. That increase in price is leading to inflation. That inflation is a tax, especially on middle class in America.”

On Monday, the national average price for a gallon of gasoline was $3.42, 16 cents more than a month ago, and $1.31 more than a year ago, according to AAA.

For his state specifically, Abbott believes Texans are in a good spot to ride this out: “With Texas being able to manufacture so much of what we actually use in this state, with the ports that we have — whether they be coastal ports or inland ports — we probably have the best access to goods of any state in the United States.”

When the Engine Stops Running… and the Power Grid Nearly Collapses

Border security, airlines, supply chain, and pump prices — these are all infrastructure. Abbott has had his own infrastructure challenges. Last February’s catastrophic winter storm and near failure of the Texas power grid left 210 people dead, according to the Department of State Health Services. While “multiple deaths [were] caused by motor vehicle accidents, carbon monoxide poisoning, exacerbation of chronic illness, falls, and fire,” the “majority of confirmed deaths were associated with hypothermia,” their website reads.

“It happened because for one, the leaders at ERCOT [Electric Reliability Council of Texas] were arrogant. I talked to them in advance of the storm, and I told them this is gonna be the worst storm we have ever had,” said Abbott. “They told me repeatedly, ‘oh, we have this under control.'”

Abbott explained “a design flaw” they operated under “where they would request more power generation only after a crisis already had occurred.”

“What kind of model to operate is that?” he questioned. “That’s chaotic.”

“We’ve changed the leadership — we got rid of all the leadership of ERCOT, we’ve got rid of all the leadership of the Public Utilities Commission. We’ve installed new leaders, with new approaches that don’t operate on a crisis-base mode, but instead, they plan in advance, and they plan for the worst-case scenario to always be prepared.”

Asked if he was confident this would never happen again, Abbott answered, “I am, for several reasons, in part because of the new leadership, in part because of the approach they take which is always assuming the worst and planning days in advance for the worst, but also because of the winterization that’s been applied because we have more power generation today than we’ve ever had before. And because everyone is preparing, as we speak today, for the very worst winter storm. I know that we will make it through the winter with keeping the power on.”

The Brandon Administration

“Let’s Go, Brandon,” said the governor on the football field.

“People are angry,” Abbott said, blaming President Biden’s “disastrous policies” for the “F*** Joe Biden” movement continuing to resonate with Americans.

“People who come to these stadiums… want to gather and celebrate a great American tradition like college football, and you have Joe Biden trying to shut things down and shut people out, and you got Fauci saying you got to stay home until Christmas or whenever,” he continued.” It’s just ludicrous – the policies that Joe Biden is advancing.”

“Only part of it relates to COVID,” he explained. “Part is about the border, part of it’s about inflation, part of it’s about the other catastrophic policies they’re implementing, so you see this rising anger across the entire United States.”

Looking ahead, “most immediately, in 13 months,” Abbott predicts “a Republican tidal wave sweep of the United States Congress.” Ripples are already being seen with the election of Glenn Youngkin in Virginia and the close gubernatorial election in New Jersey last week.

“There’s a lot of buyer’s remorse of people who voted for the Biden administration, and it looks like it will only get worse, and, Americans, they want to make sure that we are not going to lose our country forever. And the only way to do that is to have a Republican tidal wave election in 2022.”

As for his own race for a third term, Abbott’s most likely opponent in the general election — none of his primary opponents poll even remotely close enough to beat him — is former El Paso Congressman, failed Senate candidate, and failed presidential candidate, Robert Francis “Beto” O’Rourke (D). O’Rourke has yet to officially throw his hat in the race, but he is widely expected to do so in the near future. In both 2014 and 2018, Abbott won his primaries with more than 90 percent of the vote. He also won both of his general elections by double-digits.

In a recent poll from the University of Texas at Austin and the Texas Tribune, the governor has a comfortable, 9-percentage-point lead over O’Rourke, 46% to 37%.

“Texas is the number one state in so many categories, whether it be jobs, or whatever the case may be, but candidly, the most important thing is, Texas is the land of opportunity,” said Abbott when asked for his re-election pitch and thoughts on O’Rourke. “When you look at the things that [O’Rourke] has said on the campaign trail, the promises that he has made, it is a warning sign to Texans. It is a warning sign to Americans of what socialism, and candidly Marxism, looks like.”

“The last thing that we need is to have somebody come in and impose socialistic ideas and policies on a state that would ruin everything the state of Texas has ever stood for, and in destroying Texas, it would lead to the destruction of the United States of America.”

Simply put, Abbott said, O’Rourke “stands for the ideas and values that are hostile to what has made Texas great.”

Asked if he regrets anything in his administration so far, or anything he would have done differently, Abbott responded, “I’ll put it this way. There are always things that you can go back and always do better. And I would say on a daily basis, I find things that I could do better, but the goal is to constantly be looking forward and imply the aggregation of information that you gain every single day to make sure that you will be doing a better job every single day.”

“You Never Know When a Tree Is Going to Fall on You”

Abbott remains coy, like all potential, serious candidates, on his thoughts about running for president in 2024.

“You know, one thing that I’ve learned in life… I’m in a wheelchair because I was out jogging, and a tree fell on me,” he stated. “And so, my simple lesson in life is, you never know when a tree is gonna fall on you, so don’t get too far ahead of yourself.”

“I have what will be a marquee [gubernatorial] race in the United States ahead of me. My sole focus, first of all, right now, is to make sure that we get through the session, and then make sure we get through the next election.”

In this latest edition of Breitbart News’s On the Hill video series, Abbott also discusses Texas’s pro-life law, his advice to his college-aged self, and for what and for whom he prays.

“When you look at the data from Israel, it’s very clear that (the booster) reverses some of the waning effects that you see in people who have been vaccinated for six months or more,” Fauci told The Daily podcast. the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases added that the shots for vaccinated adults “are going to be an absolutely essential component of our response. Not a bonus, not a luxury, but an absolutely essential part of the program.”

Fauci’s comments come as Pfizer asked federal regulators to allow boosters of its COVID-19 vaccine for individuals 18 years of age or older. Boosters could restore protection against symptomatic infection to roughly 95 percent with similar side effects to the company’s first two vaccines, according to Pfizer’s latest study.

Food and Drug Administration (FDA) spokesperson Alison Hunt stated that the agency will review Pfizer’s application “as expeditiously as possible.” Hunt stopped short of providing a timeline for a decision.

The Biden administration had originally envisioned boosters for all adults, but faced a stinging setback in September when the FDA’s scientific advisers rejected extra Pfizer doses for everyone. The panel wasn’t convinced that young healthy people needed another dose, particularly when most of the world’s population remains unvaccinated, and instead recommended boosters just for certain groups — one of a series of decisions about extra doses for all of the three vaccines used in the U.S.

Deadline reported that sources close to Estevez indicated that creative differences may also have played a role in his exit.

Estevez reprised his role of Gordon Bombay for the Disney+ series after playing the role in the original 1992 movie and its sequels.

Watch below:

While there is no industry-wide vaccination mandate in Hollywood, individual TV and movie productions can impose their own mandates on cast and crew members.

Estevez’s departure from The Mighty Ducks series comes after actor-rapper Ice Cube left the Sony movie Oh Hell No after refusing the COVID-19 vaccine.

Ice Cube reportedly walked away from a $9 million paycheck after declining a request from the movie’s producers to get vaccinated.

Packers quarterback Aaron Rodgers spoke for the first time Friday since being diagnosed with the coronavirus earlier this week. Rodgers made his regular appearance on the Pat McAfee Show and gave his side of the story and a defense against accusations that he “lied” about being “immunized” against the virus.

Moreover, Rodgers also revealed that in combating the virus, he chose to reach out to his “now good friend” Joe Rogan and speak with him about the various treatments he used to defeat the virus.

“I consulted with a now good friend of mine, Joe Rogan, after he got COVID, and I’ve been doing a lot of the stuff he recommended in his podcasts,” Rodgers said. “I’m going to have the best immunity possible now based on the 2.5-million-person study from Israel [that shows] people who recover have the most robust immunity.

“I’m thankful for people like Joe for stepping up and using their voice. I’m thankful for my medical squad, and I’m thankful for all the love and support I’ve gotten.”

Specifically, Rodgers revealed that he has been taking Ivermectin and monoclonal antibodies.

Some 72,000 of the roughly 240,000 employees are still not in compliance, according to agency records.

According to an email reviewed by Breitbart Texas, Randolph D. Alles, DHS Under Secretary for Management, warned employees Monday that they must take the one-dose Johnson & Johnson vaccine by close of business that day. This was the only remaining option for 30 percent of the department’s 240,000 employees.

In his email to all employees, Alles wrote, “It’s not too late to meet the EO deadline, employees who receive the Johnson & Johnson vaccine today will be in full compliance with the EO by November 22. Remember, you can use duty time today to go and get your vaccine.” Alles reference to EO was in reference to President Biden’s executive order mandating all federal employees be vaccinated for COVID-19.

Supplemental materials were included as part of the campaign, warning employees who wished to submit a religious or medical exemption also faced the Monday deadline to follow the executive order. Those materials spelled out the disciplinary consequences for remaining non-compliant with the mandate:

Employees who choose to remain unvaccinated and have not submitted a request for a religious or medical exemption will be subject to discipline, up to and including removal from federal service. If an employee’s request for an exemption is not approved, the employee will then have two weeks (14 days) from being notified of the denial to receive a single dose vaccination or the first dose of a two-dose vaccination and upload proof in VSS.

“VSS” refers to a tracking program developed for use by DHS to monitor the vaccination statuses of its 240,000 employees. The system will create a record to initiate disciplinary actions on employees who are non-compliant.

The federal employee disciplinary process is governed by existing labor law and administrative court decisions. Several agencies within DHS have separate and distinct labor union contracts which dictate how departments administer labor disputes, including how the disciplinary process is conducted. This will likely make pursuing employee discipline on a wide scale time consuming for the Biden Administration.

The National Border Patrol Council (NBPC), the labor union representing rank-and-file agents, says it is prepared to challenge any attempts to discipline agents per the mandate.

Jon Anfinsen, President of the National Border Patrol Council for the Del Rio Sector, says the agency cannot afford to lose any personnel.

“The National Border Patrol Council is absolutely opposed to the vaccine mandate, and our search for a legal path continues,” he told Breitbart Texas. “The Border Patrol cannot afford to lose a single member of its workforce while the crisis at the border continues to spiral out of control.”

“Covid is not harmless in our children,” he said during an appearance on CNN’s OutFront on Tuesday.

“Many kids have died. Sadly, hundreds of children — thousands — have been hospitalized, and as a dad of a child who has been hospitalized several years ago for another illness, I would never wish upon any parent they have a child that ends up in the hospital,” Murthy said.

“And the vaccines have shown in these trials for children 5 through 11 they are more at 90 percent effective in protecting our kids from symptomatic infection,” he continued, asserting they are “remarkably safe.”

Murthy closed by urging parents: “Please consider strongly getting your children vaccinated.”

The remarks follow U.S. health officials approving of Pfizer’s shots for children ages 5 to 11, with President Joe Biden similarly begging parents to “please” get their children vaccinated.

“Because here’s the deal. Children make up one-quarter of the cases in this country and while rare, children can get very sick from COVID-19 and some can end up, few can end up hospitalized,” he said earlier this month, repeating the claim that the vaccine is “safe and effective.”

According to the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP), “among states reporting, children ranged from 1.7%-4.2% of their total cumulated hospitalizations, and 0.1%-2.0% of all their child COVID-19 cases resulted in hospitalization.” The mortality rate among children is even lower, accounting for 0.00 percent to 0.26 percent of all COVID-19 deaths. According to AAP, “7 states reported zero child death,” and “in states reporting, 0.00%-0.03% of all child COVID-19 cases resulted in death.”

Murthy’s statement comes after the Dallas Buyers Club star, who is flirting with a gubernatorial run in Texas, expressed hesitancy on vaccinating children, breaking from many of his Hollywood peers.

“I couldn’t mandate having to vaccinate the younger kids. I still want to find out more information,” McConaughey told Andrew Ross Sorkin at the New York Times DealBook summit, although he made it clear that he is personally vaccinated.

“I’m vaccinated. My wife’s vaccinated. I didn’t do it because someone told me I had to — [I] chose to do it,” the actor said. “Do I think that there’s any kind of scam or conspiracy theory? Hell no. We all got to get off that narrative. There’s not a conspiracy theory on the vaccines.”

However, the Dazed and Confused star said he will not vaccinate his children, despite the ability to do so with clearance from public health officials.

“I’m in a position though where I can do that, and I understand that not everyone can do that,” he said of opting for testing requirements."

Henry McMaster (R) announced Thursday he will issue an executive order blocking the Palmetto State’s Cabinet agencies from issuing or enforcing coronavirus vaccine mandates in the state.

The directive comes just hours after the Biden administration said it would carry out “planned inspections” and levy large fines to ensure businesses comply with its federal vaccine mandate set to take effect January 4.

“I will be issuing an Executive Order barring any South Carolina cabinet agency from issuing or enforcing any vaccine mandate,” McMaster said, adding that he will be “requiring all state agencies to report any communication with federal government on vaccine mandates, in anticipation of litigation.”

Further, McMaster labeled Biden’s vaccine mandates as a “blatantly unconstitutional” and said the restrictions “are forcing South Carolinians to choose between a vaccine and their jobs.”

The governor said South Carolina will join a lawsuit led by Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp (R) in opposition to a federal contractor vaccine mandate. To date, six other states have joined the suit and more may soon sign up.

“I presume we will have to be fighting this thing all the way to the Supreme Court on multiple fronts,” McMaster stated."

Wallace asked, “You say Texas companies should take care of their own workers so, given that, how do you justify the governor of Texas, Greg Abbott, issuing an executive order that bans any business in Texas from issuing a vaccine mandate and how do you justify the governor issuing a ban on all school districts on mask mandates, a ban that was overturned just this week by a federal judge?”

Paxton said, “So I justify it by the governor has the authority under state law in an emergency. And so he has done just that. Obviously, it’s his view that these mask mandates are unnecessary and that vaccine requirements are also unnecessary so it’s my job as the state’s attorney to go defend what he’s done and what the legislature has done and I’m perfectly comfortable doing that.”

Wallace said, “You said that Texas companies should take care of their own workers. Is that consistent with the governor’s executive order and your enforcement of that order, which bans companies from taking care of their own workers as they see fit?”

Paxton said, “What I was trying to say in the clip is that the president does not have the authority to force companies. Obviously we have a stay in the Fifth Circuit to stop them from forcing companies to require workers from getting the vaccine or fired. What I’m saying to these companies is you don’t have to listen to him because he’s out there saying that you should do it anyway despite the fact that we have a stay from a higher court.”

Wallace said, “Yeah, but you said that the businesses should take care of their own workers and the governor is saying they can’t take care of their own workers as they see fit. They’re prohibited from deciding, if they so choose, to issue a vaccine mandate. That’s not consistent.”

Paxton said, “We’re dealing with different types of requirements here. We’ve got state government requirements. So it’s clear that the governor has a different executive order for them. We’ve been in all types of litigation with school districts and counties, trying to stop them from forcing mandates in San Antonio and vaccines and we’ve been successful. We’ve no lawsuits against businesses and there’s a lot more freedom with businesses to make their own decisions. What I would say is that they should consider their employees because we are in a situation right now with the economy where we cannot to lose transportation employees or health care workers or law enforcement officers. That’s happening all over the country. It’s going to have a negative impact on our economy and our ability to help people.”

Wallace said, “I just want to go through this one more time. You’re saying that they should have the authority and the ability to decide what their workers should do. The governor’s executive order prohibits them from deciding what they want to do. He bans vaccine mandates. Isn’t a mandate by the federal government — are you saying there is a different from a mandate to get a vaccine from the federal government is different in terms of the ability to take care of their own from a state mandate not t have vaccine mandates?

Paxton said, “I think your question is a little confusing. But yes, the federal government has no authority to do this. Right now, we have OSHA guidelines that have not been authorized by the Congress. They absolutely have no authority to do this. The governor has a different authority under state law that the legislature has given him and he’s operating under that state law.”

Wallace interrupted, “So he can tell private businesses what to do? It’s OK and they can’t take care of their own?”

Paxton said, “I definitely agree that states have more authority over these areas than the federal government.”

He added, “And I would even question whether Congress has the authority.”

The resolution, which passed by a 6-1 vote, continues Oroville’s battle with the state government over the coronavirus restrictions.

According to The Guardian, “Last year, Oroville refused to enforce state requirements prohibiting indoor dining. Butte county, where Oroville is located, declined to recommend a mask mandate earlier this fall.”

Oroville’s population is roughly 20,000, and the city is 90 miles outside of the state capital, Sacramento.

Despite the city’s resolution, legal experts cast doubt about the effectiveness of the town’s efforts. According to Lisa Pruitt, a UC Davis law professor, “A municipality cannot unilaterally declare itself not subject to the laws of the state of California.”

“Whatever they mean by constitutional republic you can’t say hocus pocus and make it happen,” Pruitt added.

However, Oroville city council members recognize the legality of their resolution. Some members admit the move is just to make a political statement.

The city’s vice-mayor, Scott Thomson, spearheaded the resolution to affirm the city’s dedication to the U.S. Constitution. Thomson said:

I proposed it after 18 months of increasingly intrusive executive mandates and what I felt to be excessive overreach by our government. It’s just basically drawing the line. It’s not necessarily against one specific mandate. We’re not talking about one mandate that’s been pushing on us recently. It’s a barrage of mandates.”

Councilman Art Hartley, who voted in favor of the resolution, said, “Basically all we’re doing is making a political statement…it has absolutely no teeth.”

Other council members are worried about the fiscal impact of this resolution, as Oroville has received millions in coronavirus funding throughout the pandemic. City Attorney Scott Huber assured the city council that funding would remain intact, saying “as a result, there is no risk of loss of funding with it,” because the resolution did not change the city’s ordinance.

Huber further compared Oroville’s resolution to other California cities that defied federal immigration policies when declaring themselves “sanctuary cities.”"

The 37-year-old NFL star will be placed on the COVID-19 list for at least ten days, according to league protocols. He will then be released if he tests negative.

Defensive coordinator Joe Barry was also placed on the COVID list, according to ESPN.

Rodgers has insisted that taking a vaccine should be a personal decision and has remained one of the players who have refused to get the coronavirus vaccination. Rodgers has called the vaccine “a personal decision.”

However, at one point he also claimed he was “immunized” but did not explain exactly what that means:

Among children under the age of 15, the rate of suicide doubled in 2020. Elderly people over 80 also saw a 20 per cent increase in suicide for a total of 548 cases, Spanish newspaper El Mundo reports.

Number of People Feeling Suicidal Tripled During Lockdown: Report https://t.co/tpx8d7XiSu — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) November 10, 2020

Broken down by sex, 2,930 men and 1,011 women took their own lives in 2020 — the first year in history Spain has seen more than a thousand women commit suicide.

Clinical psychologist Miguel Guerrero spoke to the newspaper about the effect the coronavirus pandemic and associated lockdowns and economic damage have had on people in Spain, saying that “the pandemic has affected the risk factors we already knew about and has threatened protective factors, such as social cohesion.”

Guerrero added that the government should approve prevention policies immediately, saying: “Covid is a storm that we have all gone through, but some on a yacht and others in a rowboat. The pandemic has not been democratic, it has affected the most vulnerable the most.”

Clinical psychologist Luis Fernando López called the data serious, particularly the increase in suicides among children.

He further said that the data “indicates that it is not true that the kids have handled the pandemic well. It is said but it is a lie. We see a lot of self-harm, emotional disorders, eating disorders, addictions, and suicidal ideation, thoughts about death are more common than they were before. I see it in consultation.”

Earlier this year, a British study claimed that nearly five times as many children died during the pandemic from suicide than were actually killed by the coronavirus.

Data by the Royal College of Psychiatrists released last year also claimed that the number of people with suicidal thoughts had tripled during coronavirus lockdowns."

ESPN also reported that the league warned the Packers that any further violations could result in either a “possible change in draft position or loss of draft choice.”

Despite the hefty fines, the left-wing sports media was furious that the penalties were too low, and many even falsely claimed that the Rodgers fine was levied “because he lied about his vax status” – a claim that is simply untrue.

The Hollywood star issued a denial to reports claiming he left over the show’s COVID-19 vaccination policies, stating that he isn’t “anti-vaxx” but is “anti-bully.”

He also claimed his experience with “long-haul” COVID, saying he suffered from symptoms for months after coming down with the coronavirus last year.

Emilio Estevez issued a statement to Deadline following its report this weekend claiming the actor departed the show because he refused to comply with the production’s COVID-19 vaccination policies.

“I am not anti-vaxx. Full stop,” he said. “I take this pandemic very seriously, and I am often teased about my continued following of the safety protocols and my abundance of caution.”

He added: “In the final analysis, this was nothing more than a good old fashioned contract dispute and not, as some would believe an anti-vaccine position.”

Estevez said that he tested positive for COVID-19 in March 2020 after filming The Mighty Ducks pilot and claimed that his symptoms persisted through the summer and fall. He said he returned to shoot the series in Vancouver in August despite still feeling run down.

“I did not complain, nor did I release my diagnosis to the public,” he said. “I wanted to try and preserve the show morale and be a leader, however, while still suffering from Long Haul Syndrome. The legacy of the franchise was more important to me than my own health.”

He added:

In retrospect, I wrongly chose to protect the show over being transparent about having contracted Covid-19. I may have provided another public example to wit, how we are all vulnerable to this deadly disease. The quoted “anonymous sources,” producers and show runners all know the truth. Simply put, I am anti-bully. My exit from the show was due to a myriad of creative differences – any other narrative is false.

The Mighty Ducks series reportedly requires vaccination against COVID-19 for everyone in “Zone A,” which includes all actors and crew members who come into contact with them.

Estevez reprised his role of hockey coach Gordon Bombay for the Disney+ series after playing the role in the original 1992 movie and its sequels.

Austrian Chancellor Alexander Schallenberg outlined the rules Friday night after a meeting with state-level leaders to discuss the country’s response to rapidly rising coronavirus cases.

“It is simply our responsibility to protect the people in our country,” Schallenberg told reporters, noting the case numbers and increasingly full hospital intensive care units.

Previously, people could enter restaurants, hotels and other areas if they were vaccinated, had recovered from the virus or could show results from a negative test.

The government is planning a transition period for the first four weeks to encourage the unvaccinated to get shots. During that time, anyone who has received one vaccine dose and has results from a valid PCR test will be allow to attend events and enter the listed types of locations.

After four weeks, only people who are fully vaccinated or who have recovered from COVID-19 will be allowed entry.

The capital city of Vienna announced similar restrictions earlier this week.

Austria reported a pandemic high of 9,923 new confirmed coronavirus cases Saturday, surpassing its previous record of 9,586 last year. In the last seven days, the infection rate rose from 317.4 cases per 100,000 inhabitants to 522.4 cases per 100,000.

If the situation continues to worsen, further restrictions on unvaccinated people could be on the horizon. Schallenberg said last month that if ICU’s fill to one-third of the total capacity, the government would implement lockdown restrictions for residents who remain unvaccinated.

Currently, 66.7% percent of Austria’s population has received one dose of vaccine and 64.5% is fully vaccinated, one of the lowest rates in Western Europe. The Austrian government announced this week that all adults are eligible for booster shots, if six months have elapsed since their last dose.

Schallenberg called again on unvaccinated Austrians to get the vaccine, calling it a “moral responsibility.”"

The rule, which goes into effect January 4, involves “planned inspections” and heavy fines of $14,000 per violation at the start.

A senior Biden official added that employers “willfully violating a standard” will face further penalties “significantly higher than a workplace that is not willfully doing so.”

Employees who refuse to get the shot will be subject to a coronavirus test “at least weekly” if they are in an office at least once a week, or “within 7 days before returning to work” if away from the office for over a week. Notably, the ETS does not place the burden of testing costs on the employer, but on the unvaccinated individual. However, OSHA says employers may be required to pay some of the costs of testing because of other laws or bargaining agreements. Nonetheless, the agency itself is not requiring employers to do so:

The ETS does not require employers to pay for any costs associated with testing. However employer payment for testing may be required by other laws, regulations, or collective bargaining agreements or other collectively negotiated agreements. In addition, nothing prohibits employers from voluntarily assuming the costs associated with testing. Additionally, the rule requires employers to force unvaccinated individuals to wear a face covering in virtually all scenarios — when indoors or “when occupying a vehicle with another person for work purposes, except in certain limited circumstances”: Employers must not prevent any employee, regardless of vaccination status, from voluntarily wearing a face covering unless it creates a serious workplace hazard (e.g., interfering with the safe operation of equipment)."

“I really think that people do need to stand up and stand for what they believe to be true,” Florida’s surgeon general said when asked what advice he would give to Americans who are facing mandates which could potentially impact their lives and livelihoods.

“I mean, I think that unfortunately, part of the reason we’ve gotten to a place now where people who once said on the record that you couldn’t force people to take vaccine for COVID-19 are now saying the opposite thing — that in fact not only can you, you should force people to take this vaccine — I think that … part of the reason that has happened is because enough people have not been outspoken about their rights,” Ladapo said. “So I think that these medical decisions are for people to make. I think that goes from everything from masks mandates to now these vaccinate mandates and vaccine passports.”

“And I think that if people who don’t agree that that’s the appropriate approach, policy approach, the appropriate health policy approach, to these problems, if they don’t speak up, we can expect more of the same and worse,” he predicted. “I think this is the time for people to speak up.”

Ladapo claimed that such policies have “worsened racial and ethnic disparities” but expressed his belief that the motives are “not about health.”

“It’s not about the improvement of health,” he explained before discussing the vilifying tone touted by Biden’s administration and the commander-in-chief himself, who in September warned that his patience was “wearing thin” with unvaccinated Americans.

“It promotes division, and what’s worse is that it basically demonstrates no respect for human rights and human autonomy and the right for people to make health decisions, which they really do have,” he said, explaining that some public health officials have successfully convinced Americans that “they don’t have permission to make decisions about their health.”

COVID-19 vaccines are effective at reducing the risk of severe illness, hospitalization & death. There are also concerns about uncommon but underreported adverse events, some data quality, & suppression of politically unpopular perspectives. https://t.co/Noq6I2n2ZC — Joseph A. Ladapo, MD, PhD (@FLSurgeonGen) November 4, 2021

“And instead, they just have to agree and go along with whatever they are saying — whatever these health officials are saying — and it’s just terrible,” Ladapo told Breitbart News. “I think anyone who cares about civil liberties would have to be alarmed at the fact that they are determined to impose these one-size-fits-all health decisions on everyone.”

“Not only is it an affront to human rights, it’s also scientifically just ridiculous. The difference, for example, in mortality between children and older people from COVID is literally 1,000-fold. There’s literally — the risk is 1,000 times higher. So it’s just not sensible, and again, it’s really disrespectful and harmful to human rights and human dignity,” he added.

Ladapo’s remarks were part of a larger interview with Breitbart News on Friday, centered around the accusations lodged against Ladapo by the left, including MSNBC’s Rachel Maddow, who attempted to discredit Ladapo’s years of work in a lengthy segment on her show this week. Citing anonymous sources, Maddow questioned Ladapo’s career — particularly his experience working with coronavirus patients at UCLA.

“I was taking care of patients with COVID-19 when I was working in the hospital in March, and this is before the COVID-19 team treatment team was established,” he told Breitbart News, adding that he initially volunteered to be on the COVID-19 team as well, although he had to rescind the offer due to family obligations.

“I volunteered again just to help out in November [2020] specifically with COVID patients … and then when the team was dissolved, the COVID-19. Team was dissolved in January 2021, patients with COVID came to all the medical teams. So I had those patients when they came to the hospital from the emergency department,” he said. “They came directly to my team.”

“So it was strange to kind of see the story because it’s factually incorrect and certainly just seemed like an attempt to discredit someone who — like 10 years of my career has been based on my credibility, both clinically and in research, and they’re sort of trying to make people believe something else than what is actually true about me and my career,” he said of Maddow’s segment."

“[F]rom 8 December 2021, we will begin charging COVID-19 [Chinese coronavirus] patients who are unvaccinated by choice,” Singapore’s Ministry of Health said in a press release issued November 8.

“This will apply to all unvaccinated COVID-19 patients admitted on or after 8 December 2021 to hospitals and CTFs,” the ministry clarified.

“COVID-19,” or the Chinese coronavirus, is the name of the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2, which is a type of coronavirus. “CTF” stands for “Covid-19 Treatment Facility.” The sites provide “medical capabilities and resources, including oxygen supplementation, to safely manage patients who may be at risk of developing severe illness,” according to the Singapore-based Straits Times.

Singapore’s Health Ministry said on November 8 it would continue to cover the full cost of “COVID-19 medical bills for those who are ineligible for vaccination … i.e. children under 12 years old or medically ineligible persons.”

Singapore’s government currently pays all costs tied to coronavirus-related medical bills for all Singaporeans. The city-state extends this financial aid to Singapore’s permanent residents and long-term residence pass holders, with the exception of individuals “who tested positive or had onset of Covid-19 symptoms within 14 days of arrival in Singapore after overseas travel.”

The Singapore Ministry of Health said Monday it decided to withdraw free coronavirus medical treatment for people unvaccinated against the disease because the demographic currently comprises “a sizeable majority of those who require intensive inpatient care, and disproportionately contribute to the strain on our healthcare resources.”

The Republic of Singapore is a sovereign island city-state in Southeast Asia with a population of nearly 6 million. Government data published on November 8 revealed 85 percent of Singaporeans were fully vaccinated against the Chinese coronavirus.

“Both first and second doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech/Comirnaty, Moderna and Sinovac vaccines are currently being administered,” the Straits Times reported on November 10.

“Those eligible for booster doses are also being invited to receive their third shots. As at Nov 8, 18 per cent of Singapore’s population have received boosters [sic],” the newspaper noted.

“Booster” shots are additional doses of a vaccine a person receives after he or she has already completed a full dosage of the inoculation.

Both Pfizer-BioNTech/Comirnaty and Moderna produce coronavirus vaccines based on new mRNA technology, while China’s state-made Sinovac is based on more established inactivated virus technology. The mRNA vaccines inject part of the Chinese coronavirus’ genetic code into a person’s body, thus triggering the production of viral proteins. This process trains the recipient’s immune system to attack the Chinese coronavirus should it encounter it in the future. Inactivated virus vaccines inject killed viral particles into a recipient’s body to expose the person’s immune system to the virus.

Both Pfizer and Moderna are multinational pharmaceutical and biotech corporations based in the U.S. Pfizer partnered with the German biotech firm BioNTech and the Chinese company Fosun Pharma to develop a coronavirus vaccine named “Comirnaty.” Sinovac is a Chinese state-owned biopharmaceutical company that produces a Chinese coronavirus vaccine known as “Sinovac-CoronaVac.”"

Sesame Street characters participated in a CNN town hall meeting about the vaccines, informing children that the vaccines were good and important.

Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX) described Big Bird’s messaging as government propaganda.

Cruz further reacted to the controversy, noting that when people criticized Big Bird, liberals “lose their sh**.”

Kremlin officials have ordered Moscow to shutter all businesses and non-essential services in the city from October 28 to November 7 in an effort to curb the Russian national capital’s latest coronavirus surge. Moscow is home to roughly 13 million residents.

“Russia has rolled out several homegrown [coronavirus] vaccines including Sputnik V but only about a third of the population is fully innoculated,” Agence France-Presse (AFP) reported November 1.

“Russia’s single-dose Sputnik Light vaccine produces a strong antibody response among recipients, according to research published Wednesday in [the] leading medical journal The Lancet,” the Moscow Times observed on November 5.

“Sputnik Light is the first dose of Russia’s two-dose Sputnik V vaccine, which is the backbone of Russia’s domestic vaccination campaign and is being sold around the world,” according to the newspaper.

The Moscow Times referred to a study published by the Lancet on November 3 which analyzed the results of phase I and II trials of Sputnik Light. The single-dose Sputnik Light vaccine demonstrated a “good safety profile” and “induces a strong immune response” in recipients, especially in those who have already contracted coronavirus, according to the study’s researchers.

“The vaccine, a single-dose version of the two-dose Sputnik V vaccine unveiled last year, has already entered later phases of studies and is widely used in Russia, but the publication of the early research in a top Western journal is a milestone as Russia moves towards making Sputnik Light its main vaccine for export,” Reuters noted of the vaccine on November 3.

“Sputnik Light might be considered not only for primary vaccination, but also could be useful as an efficient tool for further revaccination or vaccination after previous COVID-19 [Chinese coronavirus] infection,” according to the Lancet-published study."

The Robert Koch Institute, Germany’s national disease control center, registered 50,196 new cases, up from 33,949 daily cases a week earlier. Infections have multiplied so quickly in recent days that hospitals in the hardest-hit regions canceled scheduled surgeries to allow medical personnel to focus on COVID-19 patients.

The institute also reported 237 daily COVID-19 deaths, bringing Germany´s pandemic death toll to 97,198. One of the country’s top virologists, Christian Drosten, warned on Wednesday that another 100,000 people could die in the coming months if the country’s vaccination rate didn’t accelerate quickly.

Unlike some other European countries, Germany has balked at making vaccinations mandatory for certain categories of workers and has struggled to persuade more people to voluntarily get shots.

At least 67% of the population of 83 million is fully vaccinated, according to official figures.

“In Germany, I must say, unfortunately, that our vaccination rate isn´t high enough to prevent the fast spread of the virus,” Chancellor Angela Merkel said late Wednesday.

Vice Chancellor Olaf Scholz who is likely to take over as chancellor echoed Merkel, telling lawmakers that everything must be done to get more people vaccinated.

“The virus is still among us and threatening our health,” said Scholz. “We must make sure that vaccinations are conducted and that they are conducted at high speed.”

A caretaker national government has governed Germany since a September parliamentary election. The three parties that are expected to form the new government are looking to replace a March, 2020 “national epidemic” declaration at the end of the month with new legislation for enacting COVID-19 measures.

Scholz announced that the three parties – his own Social Democrats, the Greens and the pro-business Free Democrats – plan to to re-open vaccination centers across the country so that people can receive booster shots swiftly.

Other virus measures include free tests, daily or frequent testing at nursing homes and schools and tougher enforcement of measures.

Germany has had a patchwork of regional rules throughout the pandemic. Most places permit access to many indoor facilities and events only to those people who have been vaccinated, have recovered from COVID-19 or had a recent negative test.

Scholz said both he and Merkel agreed that the federal government and all 16 states need to meet again next week to find common solutions on how to counter the infection spike.

“That is what we need now: for the country to stick together and pull in one direction so that we can get through this winter,” said Scholz."

In a virtual town hall on November 2, which was posted to the city’s YouTube channel, San Francisco Public Health Officer Dr. Susan Phillip stated, “today is an exciting day,”

“We’re all very happy to have heard that the CDC has just recommended the COVID-19 vaccine for all children ages five to eleven,” Phillip added. “It’s a very exciting day.”

“People have asked me, what about the local San Francisco health orders that require vaccination to go into a restaurant or to go to a Warriors game,” Phillip stated during the meeting, as reported by KRON. “When is that going to apply to children 5 to 11? We definitely want to wait and make sure children have an opportunity to get vaccinated so that will happen no sooner than about eight weeks after the vaccine is available to kids.”

“So there will be a limited time in which there will not be those requirements as planned but at some point, 5 to 11-year-olds will also have to show proof of vaccination to access some of those same settings,” she added, per KRON.

Currently, San Francisco requires proof of vaccination for children over 12 to gain entry to restaurants, gyms, and large indoor events, among other indoor facilities, according to the city’s website. The requirement for proof of vaccination went into effect August 20.

“We’re requiring vaccines to protect everyone against the continued spread of COVID-19. We want to cut down the spread of COVID-19 and keep San Francisco businesses open” the city’s website states."

The nation… [+6122 chars]",Right,"California is among three U.S. states now allowing coronavirus booster shots for all adults even though federal health officials recommend limiting doses to those considered most at risk.

The nation's most populous state, along with Colorado and New Mexico, instituted their policies to try to head off a feared surge around the end-of-year holidays when more people are gathering inside.

Colorado and New Mexico have among the nation's highest rates of new infections, while California — lowest in the nation earlier this fall — now joins them in the ""high"" tier for transmission, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

GREG GUTFIELD: WAR NEEDS AN ENDING OR IT WON'T END

New Mexico Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham signed an executive order Friday expanding eligibility for COVID-19 booster shots. Her state health department's acting secretary, Dr. David Scrase, said rising case numbers have some hospitals in New Mexico overwhelmed.

""COVID-19 is incredibly opportunistic and it’s our job to ensure that the virus has fewer and fewer opportunities to spread,"" Scrase said. ""If it’s time for you to get a booster, please do so right away.""

President Joe Biden’s administration had sought approval for boosters for all adults, but U.S. Food and Drug Administration advisers in September decided it isn’t clear that young healthy people need another dose. They instead recommended boosters only for those over 65 and younger people with certain underlying health conditions or whose jobs are high risk for the virus.

In California, state Public Health Officer Tomás Aragón sent a letter to local health officials and providers saying they should ""allow patients to self-determine their risk of exposure.""

AUSTRIAN BROTHEL OFFERING FREE ENTRY, PRIVATE SESSION FOR THOSE WHO GET VACCIINATED ON-SITE

""Do not turn a patient away who is requesting a booster"" if they are age 18 and up and it has been six months since they had their second Moderna or Pfizer vaccine or two months since their single Johnson & Johnson shot, he wrote.

He told pharmacies to prioritize boosters to those in skilled nursing or assisted living facilities due to waning immunity from the earlier shots. But generally, providers ""should not miss any opportunity"" to give vaccines to the unvaccinated or boosters to everyone else anytime they visit a drug store, hospital or medical office.

Many states are now experiencing rising cases and more hospitalizations. Nationwide in the last week there were about 73,000 new cases daily, roughly 10,000 more than three weeks ago.

In Colorado, where some hospitals are stretched to the breaking point, Gov. Jared Polis signed an executive order on Thursday to expand use of booster shots. A day later he had a dire warning for the roughly 20% of eligible people in his state who have yet to get a single dose.

""We wouldn’t even be here talking about this if everyone was vaccinated,"" the Democratic governor said at a news conference. ""If you are not vaccinated, you’re going to get COVID. Maybe this year, maybe next year.""

AUSTRIA SET TO IMPOSE NATIONWIDE LOCKDOWN FOR UNVACCINATED

Officials in Colorado, California and New Mexico said they have ample supplies of vaccines to provide initial vaccinations and boosters to all who want them.

White House press secretary Jen Psaki on Friday said the Biden administration continues to advise health leaders across the country ""to abide by public health guidelines coming from the federal government.""

California Health and Human Services Secretary Dr. Mark Ghaly earlier in the week said California's decision doesn't conflict with federal guidelines. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention was ""very clear that they had two categories — groups that should get a booster and groups that may."" he said.

""We know that a number of Californians work in crowded public settings,"" Ghaly said. ""Because of your work-related risk or even you live with people who have underlying conditions (and) are at higher risk themselves, or you’re a member of a community that’s been ravished and hard-hit by COVID ... it’s permissive by the CDC and the FDA to go ahead and get the booster.""

Dr. Kirsten Bibbins-Domingo, a professor of epidemiology at University of California, San Francisco, said boosters have lagged. That's worrisome as winter approaches and the highly contagious delta variant, which caused a summer spike, continues to circulate.

The delta variant is ""really good at finding people, including people who got vaccinated at the beginning of the year and now that vaccination is wearing off a little bit,"" she said. ""Delta is a powerful force and everybody needs that third dose."""

The Biden administration is asking a federal court to lift an order that blocked its rule mandating that larger employers require workers to get COVID-19 vaccines or submit to regular testing.

The request, filed Monday, comes after the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals ruled in favor of a group of businesses to halt the order, citing ""grave statutory and constitutional issues."" The ruling put the mandate on hold until pending litigation could be heard.

But the administration claims that the companies that won the emergency stay were not claiming a major prospect of harm from the rule until December, arguing that the court should allow the mandate to proceed.

HOUSE REPUBLICANS MOVE TO STALL BIDEN'S VACCINE MANDATE

""Accordingly, there is no need to address petitioners’ stay motions now, and the Court should lift its administrative stay and allow this matter to proceed under the process that Congress set forth for judicial review of OSHA standards,"" lawyers for the administration argued in a federal appeals court.

The Occupational Safety and Health Administration regulation is set to apply to employers with at least 100 workers, creating a temporary rule that will require those companies to mandate workers be vaccinated against COVID-19 or submit to regular testing. A deadline for companies to comply with the regulation was then set for Jan. 4.

But the mandate was the subject of several lawsuits from states, companies and business groups, who argue it could hinder the economic recovery just as the holiday season goes into high gear.

Meanwhile, the Biden administration has encouraged large employers to comply with the mandate as the case makes its way through the court system.

""We think people should not wait,"" White House deputy press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said. ""Do not wait to take actions that will keep your workplace safe. It is important and critical to do, and waiting to get more people vaccinated will lead to more outbreaks and sickness.

""The Department of Labor has a responsibility to keep workers safe and the legal authority to do so,"" Jean-Pierre added.

President Biden initially announced the new mandate in September, saying at the time that it was a critical step to increase the number of vaccinated Americans.

""We've been patient, but our patience is wearing thin, and your refusal has cost all of us,"" Biden said at the time. ""While America is in much better shape than it was seven months ago when I took office … we're in a tough stretch, and it could last for a while."""

The countries with the highest numbers of new cases worldwide were the United States, Russia, Britain, Turkey and Germany. The number of weekly COVID-19 deaths fell by about 4% worldwide and declined in every region except Europe.

""In a huge win in the fight for liberty, personal, health and medical freedom, state’s rights and the American values that underlie all of those aforementioned things, the 5th circuit court of appeals has halted Biden’s unconstitutional, tyrannical and BS vaccine mandate for businesses,"" she said, praising Texas Attorney Gen. Ken Paxton for leading the legal effort to block what she said is a constitutionally dubious edict from Biden.

Paxton was joined in the effort by his colleagues in Utah, Mississippi, South Carolina and Louisiana.

On Fox Nation, Lahren questioned Biden's claim that he must as president protect vaccinated Americans from unvaccinated Americans, given the fact that people who have received the vaccine jab can still contract the respiratory virus anyway.

She called the weekly-testing carveout for non-public workers ""smoke and mirrors"", as many employers will simply pass the cost and inconvenience onto their employees to handle. Qualifying COVID tests for travelers at places such as Newark and Logan Airports can set a patient back hundreds of dollars at a time, for comparison.

""And to make it even more communist-friendly, this mandate would weaponize OSHA, allowing them to send agents to businesses to check for compliance and if not, be fined over $136,000,"" she said.

""What a not-only-unconstitutional but stupid thing to implement during a supply chain and worker shortage crisis.""

""Health and safety sure sounds a lot like communism mixed with complete and utter lunacy but hey, that’s the trademark of this administration so, not surprised. Stalin and Mao would be so proud.""

Lahren went on to characterize Biden as a ""sleepy, wannabe-dictator"" who is oppressing his own citizens while inviting what could soon be millions of illegal immigrants into the United States with de facto vaccine-mandate exemptions:

""[M]illions of illegals have invaded and are continuing to invade our nation- unmasked, vaxxed or tested. It’s infuriating, it’s wrong and it’s unamerican,"" she said.

Several coaches and front office executives complained that their teams were held to different standards, according to ESPN.

EXPLAINER: RODGERS AND HOW THE NFL'S COVID-19 PROTOCOLS WORK

One executive told the outlet that he received a memo from the league that clearly stated: ""Any such individual with bench area access who is not fully vaccinated — except for active players — shall be required to wear masks at all times. Unvaccinated inactive players must also wear masks.""

Another called it ""B.S.,"" saying his franchise's players ""wore masks all the time.""

According to NFL Network , the NFL has begun reviewing video and other evidence as part of its investigation into Green Bay’s compliance with COVID protocols after Rodgers tested positive for the virus and confirmed Friday that he opted for homeopathic treatments during the offseason instead of the vaccine.

""The primary responsibility for enforcement of the COVID protocols within club facilities rests with each club,"" the league said in a statement. ""Failure to properly enforce the protocols has resulted in discipline being assessed against individual clubs in the past.""

The NFL is also looking into a Halloween party where Rodgers and several Packers players were seen attending and pictured without masks, a possible violation of the league’s COVID policies.

Sources told ESPN that the Packers are likely facing fines for any violations but no suspensions.

Rodgers took aim at the NFL in his interview on ""The Pat McAfee Show"" saying he didn’t believe the NFL's policies were based on scientific fact.

""Some of the rules, to me, are not based in science at all. They’re purely trying to out and shame people, like needing to wear a mask at a podium when every person in the room is vaccinated and wearing a mask – makes no sense to me,"" Rodgers said. ""If you got vaccinated to protect yourself from a virus I don’t have as an unvaccinated individual, then why are you worried about anything I could give you?"""

The city of Austin gave Fox News Digital the following statement:

""Every year, Austin Center for Events (ACE) works with the Austin Veterans Parade Foundation, the event organizers of the Veterans Parade, as they plan for this important event to honor the American heroes who made the ultimate sacrifice for our great country.

Over the summer, we proactively reached out to the event organizer to work through the event permitting process and help them understand health mitigation requirements for special events. The organizers did not submit a COVID-19 Health & Safety form to Austin Public Health for review. On September 28th, the organizers notified ACE that they decided to cancel the event citing the health requirements for an event with 30,000 attendees. At this time, Austin was in Stage 4 of the Risk Based Guidelines and the region had 25 ICU beds left to serve millions of Central Texans. The City is now working with the Parade Foundation on a ribbon cutting dedication ceremony for the Veteran’s Pocket Park.

ACE, which includes Austin Public Health (APH), reviews COVID-19 safety for special events. During the COVID-19 pandemic, ACE and APH have met regularly, at least every 30 days, to review safety requirements. Over the last 18 months, those requirements have evolved based on current conditions, including the Austin-Travis County Risk-Based Guidelines. A document, Bringing Events Back: Austin-Travis County COVID-19 Safety Guide for Venues & Special Events, was developed and is regularly updated to help indoor venues and outdoor events understand COVID safety at events. The current event guidelines which regulate events permitted by the Austin Center for Events are designed to create the safest environment possible.

Currently, an event must be able to follow the enhanced mitigation criteria:

· Conduct screening of all attendees including but not limited to requiring proof of a negative COVID-19 test result within 72 hours of entering an event.

· Develop strategies for maintaining at least 6 feet of social distancing.

· Include ""mask zones"" in outdoor event areas where social distancing is not possible.

For indoor events with 1,000+ attendees, and outdoor events with 2,500+, the submitted Health and Safety Form must be approved by the Austin Public Health Department. An APH staff member will review an applicant’s form and either approve their plans or work with them on strengthening mitigation efforts so they can hold a safe event. As conditions improve, we will continue working with event organizers to implement measures that reduce the risk of spreading COVID."""

While reported cases of measles have fallen compared with previous years, a new report from the CDC and World Health Organization (WHO) says that progress towards measles elimination continues to decline and that the risk of outbreaks is building.

Last year, the agency said in a news release, more than 22 million infants missed their first dose of the measle vaccine, marking the largest increase in two decades.

RISING COVID-19 CASES FORCE HOSPITALS IN SOME STATES TO TAKE ACTION

Only 70% of children received their second dose of measles vaccine and 24 measles vaccination campaigns in 23 countries were postponed because of the pandemic.

While reported measles cases decreased by over 80% in 2020, measles surveillance also deteriorated.

The CDC said 2020 saw the lowest number of specimens sent for lab testing in over a decade.

Major measles outbreaks occurred in 26 countries and accounted for 84% of all reported cases in 2020.

As of Nov. 10, 2021, CDC data shows that a total of 47 measles cases were reported by four jurisdictions in the U.S.

The agency warned urged that countries and global health partners prioritize finding and vaccinating children against measles to prevent future deaths and outbreaks.

""While reported measles cases dropped in 2020, evidence suggests we are likely seeing the calm before the storm as the risk of outbreaks continues to grow around the world,"" Dr. Kate O’Brien, the director of WHO’s Department of Immunization, Vaccines and Biologicals, said in a statement. ""It’s critical that countries vaccinate as quickly as possible against COVID-19, but this requires new resources so that it does not come at the cost of essential immunization programs. Routine immunization must be protected and strengthened; otherwise, we risk trading one deadly disease for another.""

US WILL DISTRIBUTE JOHNSON & JOHNSON VACCINE IN CONFLICT ZONES, BLINKEN SAYS

While measles is one of the world's most contagious human viruses, it is almost entirely preventable through vaccination.

Over the course of the last 20 years, the measles vaccine is estimated to have averted more than 30 million deaths globally.

The estimated number of measles cases in 2020 was 7.5 million around the world.

The measles virus lives in the nose and throat mucus of an infected person and can spread by coughing, sneezing, breathing contaminated air or touching infected surfaces and then touching one's eyes, nose or mouth. Animals do not get or spread measles.

If one person has measles, up to 90% of the people close to that person who are not immune will also become infected.

Before the measles vaccination program started in 1963, an estimated 3 to 4 million people got measles each year in the U.S.

In 2000, the U.S. declared that measles was eliminated from the country due to the highly effective measles vaccine.

However, unvaccinated travelers get measles while they are in other countries and bring it to America every year. Typically, two out of three of the unvaccinated travelers are Americans. The CDC warns that measles could re-establish itself in the U.S.

Measles symptoms typically appear 7 to 14 days after contact with the virus. Those symptoms usually include high fever, cough, runny nose and watery eyes. A measles rash appears 3 to 5 days after the first symptoms."

EXCLUSIVE: Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis on Monday announced his plans to run for re-election in 2022, saying he has ""delivered on all fronts"" in his first term leading the Sunshine State, and telling Fox News that he's ""only just begun to fight.""

DeSantis formally filed paperwork to make his re-election campaign official. DeSantis was elected in 2018, and his current term is expected to expire in January 2023.

When I became governor, I pledged to foster economic opportunity, support K-12 education, usher in a new era for Florida’s Everglades and water resources, ensure the integrity of our elections and stand for public safety and the rule of law,"" DeSantis told Fox News.

DeSantis said he has ""delivered on all fronts: Florida’s economy is strong, we’ve boosted teacher pay, made historic investments in Everglades restoration and water quality, signed strong election integrity legislation, provided unparalleled support for law enforcement and appointed strong constitutionalists to our state courts.""

""I also protected individual Floridians and small businesses by keeping Florida open and stood up for students and parents by ensuring schools provided in-person instruction and by championing the rights of parents,"" DeSantis continued. ""We’ve also taken on Big Tech censorship, banned sanctuary cities, ensured that municipalities cannot defund law enforcement and stood up to the Biden regime.""

He added: ""And I’ve only just begun to fight.""

At this point, DeSantis only faces on Republican challenger in the GOP primary -- John Joseph Mercadante, who mounted a GOP gubernatorial bid in the state's primary in 2018.

There are a number of Democrats who have declared their candidacy for the Democrat primary--including Charlie Joseph Crist, Nikki Fried, David Nelson Freeman, Ivan Graham, Jonathan Karns, Amaro Lionheart, Alexander Lundmark, Timothy Lemont Mosley, Annettee Taddeo, Robert Lee Wills, and Randy Zapata.

Independent David Wayne Gizmo Wexler and Frank Hughs Jr., who has no party affiliation, have also announced their intention to run."

The Biden administration on Monday kicked off ""a nationwide effort"" to encourage schools, parents and guardians to vaccinate children against COVID, saying ""vaccination is the best tool we have"" to ensure students are safe, and that schools remain opened for in-person learning.

Education Secretary Miguel Cardona and Health and Human Service Secretary Xavier Becerra sent a letter to school superintendents and elementary school principals across the nation Monday morning, encouraging them to share information with families about COVID-19 vaccines for children.

COVID-19 VACCINATION AND YOUNG CHILDREN: WHAT TO KNOW

The letter comes just days after the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommended use of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine for children ages 5 through 11 years old.

""Today, we reach out to you with encouragement for you to actively support the vaccination process for children in your state, territories, county, tribes, communities and schools,"" they wrote. ""This is a very exciting development and a significant opportunity to protect some of our youngest learners and our communities.""

""Vaccination is the best tool we have to keep our students safe from COVID-19, maintain in-person learning, and prevent the closure of schools and cancellation of valued extracurricular activities,"" they wrote, adding that vaccination, ""paired with prevention strategies"" like masking, testing, tracing, distancing and improving ventilation ""can significantly limit COVID-19 transmission.""

""Schools play a vital role in providing access to and trusted information on the vaccine,"" they wrote, adding that ""parents listen closely to school leaders and personnel.""

""We urge you to do all you can to help parents and families learn about the vaccine and get access to it,"" they wrote.

CDC DIRECTOR WALENSKY SIGNS OFF ON PFIZER VACCINE FOR CHILDREN 5 TO 11

Cardona and Becerra requested that schools host COVID-19 vaccine clinics, noting that the CDC has developed resources for schools to use in standing clinics up, and pointing to funding in the American Rescue Plan and through FEMA ""to ensure that you can cover all costs of hosting a clinic.""

They also requested that schools distribute information about the COVID-19 vaccines to all families with children between the ages of 5 and 11.

""Parents rely on their children’s teachers, principals, school nurses, and other school personnel to help keep their students safe and healthy every school year,"" they wrote. ""The communications you issue—in languages accessible to your parents—will be critical in helping families learn more about the vaccine.""

They added: ""We encourage you to use this opportunity to highlight the safety and effectiveness of vaccines and explain why they are critical to protecting individuals from COVID-19, lowing community and family transmission, and keeping children safely in in-person learning.""



Cardona and Becerra said that, ""as parents ourselves, we understand that parents of children who are newly eligible for the vaccine will have questions about the vaccine.""

They also urged schools to hold conversations and community engagements on COVID vaccines with parents in partnership with local pediatricians and other trusted medical voices in their communities.

TRUMP SURGEON GENERAL SPEAKS OUT ON VACCINATING KIDS

Cardona and Becerra also suggested partnering with community or faith-based organizations as well as collaborating with student leaders ""to make efforts fun and get young people to participate.""

""We need your help now more than ever to continue to protect our communities and our children,"" they wrote.

The letter comes ahead of first lady Jill Biden and U.S. Surgeon General Vivek Murthy’s visit to a school vaccination clinic in Virginia on Monday.

That visit, according to a White House official, will ""kick off a nationwide effort from the Biden administration to encourage parents and guardians to vaccinate children ages 5-11.""

The first lady’s visit will be the first White House visit to a pediatric COVID-19 vaccination clinic since the CDC’s recommendation of the use of the pediatric Pfizer vaccine on Nov. 2.

A White House official told Fox News that the effort will include the first lady, over the coming weeks, visiting pediatric COVID-19 vaccination clinics across the country, including at schools, children’s hospitals and other community sites, and will encourage more sites to offer vaccines for children in their communities.

The official also told Fox News that the Biden administration is encouraging school districts across the country to set up ""school-located vaccine clinics"" by using funds from the American Rescue Plan ""to help operationalize these clinics,"" and by using providers through the Federal Retail Pharmacy Program to administer vaccines."

The CDC officially recommended the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine for children ages 5-11 on Nov. 2, following prior approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), opening up vaccinations to 28 million kids across the country.

Earlier this month, the White House assured that the government has enough of the Pfizer vaccine for all of that age group.

""We're in great shape on supply,"" White House coronavirus coordinator Jeff Zients said during a briefing.

Zients said Wednesday that about 900.000 kids in that age group will have received their first dose of the COVID-19 vaccine in their first week of eligibility and about 700,000 first-shot appointments are scheduled for the coming days.

CDC DIRECTOR WALENSKY SIGNS OFF ON PFIZER VACCINE FOR CHILDREN 5 TO 11

Nearly 20,000 pharmacies, clinics and physicians' offices are administering the doses to younger kids, and those who get their first of two shots by the end of next week will be fully vaccinated by Christmas.

At the end of October, the FDA affirmed results from Pfizer showing that its two-dose shot was nearly 91% effective at preventing symptomatic infection in young children.

While children are less likely to suffer severe COVID-19 infections, with the delta variant, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases Director Dr. Anthony Fauci said kids get infected and transmit ""just as readily as adults do.""

More than 2 million COVID-19 cases have been reported in U.S. children ages 5 to 11 since the pandemic started, according to the CDC, including 66 deaths over the past year.

Moderna and Johnson & Johnson vaccines are still being tested.

Democratic Kansas Gov. Laura Kelly came out against President Biden’s vaccine mandate as one that is not the ""most effective"" or ""correct"" for her state.

""Yesterday, I reviewed the new vaccine mandate from the Biden Administration. While I appreciate the intention to keep people safe, a goal I share, I don’t believe this directive is the correct, or the most effective, solution for Kansas,"" she said in a statement released Friday.

""States have been leading the fight against COVID-19 from the start of the pandemic. It is too late to impose a federal standard now that we have already developed systems and strategies that are tailored for our specific needs,"" she continued.

Biden directed all private companies with 100 employees or more to enforce a vaccine requirement starting Jan 4.

The 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals on Saturday, however, granted an emergency stay of the vaccine requirement by the federal Occupational Safety and Health Administration.

Louisiana Attorney General Jeff Landry said the action stops Biden ""from moving forward with his unlawful overreach.""

""The president will not impose medical procedures on the American people without the checks and balances afforded by the constitution,"" a statement from Landry, a Republican, said.

Biden’s vaccine mandate for businesses was hit with fierce and immediate pushback earlier this year when it was first announced.

Republicans hit back at the mandate when it was first announced in September as ""unconstitutional.""

As for Kelly, she said she will ""seek a resolution"" on vaccine mandates that ""continues to recognize the uniqueness of our state and builds on our on-going efforts to combat a once-in-a-century crisis.""

Kelly is up for reelection next year. GOP challenger Kansas Attorney General Derek Schmidt's campaign team hit back in a statement on Kelly's remarks, saying she has remained quiet on Biden's vaccine mandate for two months, while Schmidt has been fighting the mandate.

""Attorney General Schmidt has been fighting Joe Biden's mandates since the moment they were announced. After two months of silence, Laura Kelly has now voiced her concerns some 36 hours after her party suffered defeat in blue state Virginia - words accompanied by no action. Kansans are smart, and can see which candidate is acting on principle defending their livelihood and which is making a desperate political ploy to save her own job,"" Schmidt's campaign manager CJ Grover tweeted Friday.

Beginning Monday, bans on travel from specific countries are over . The U.S. will allow in international travelers, but they must be vaccinated — with a few exceptions.

The U.S. is also reopening the land borders with Canada and Mexico for vaccinated people. Most trips from Canada and Mexico to the U.S. are by land rather than air.

BIDEN ADMIN KICKS OFF ‘NATIONWIDE EFFORT’ TO GET CHILDREN VACCINATED AGAINST COVID-19

Here are some questions and answers about the changes:

WHY ARE THESE CHANGES HAPPENING?

The goal is to restore more normal travel while limiting the spread of COVID-19, the government says. The travel industry and European allies have pushed for an end to country-specific bans. Americans have been allowed to fly to Europe for months, and Europeans have been pushing the U.S. to change its policies.

In 2019, before the pandemic, about one-fifth of the roughly 79 million visitors to the U.S. came from Europe.

WHAT ARE THE MAIN REQUIREMENTS?

All adult foreign nationals traveling to the U.S. must be fully vaccinated before boarding their flight. Like before, travelers will still have to show proof of a negative COVID-19 test taken within 72 hours of departure to the U.S.

EVERYONE NEEDS TO BE VACCINATED?

Yes, with some exceptions. Children under 18 don't need to be vaccinated but they do need to take a COVID test. Kids 2 and younger are exempt from testing requirements.

WHAT ABOUT ADULTS WHO AREN'T VACCINATED?

Since half the world remains unvaccinated, and vaccine distribution has been so skewed to rich countries, the Biden administration is leaving a loophole for people who live in countries where vaccines are scarce. That list includes about 50 countries where fewer than 10% of people have been vaccinated. Travelers from those countries will need permission from the U.S. government to come, and it can't be just for tourism or business travel.

The U.S. government says it will permit unvaccinated international visitors to enter the country if there is a humanitarian or emergency reason, such as an emergency medical evacuation. Those exceptions will be applied ""extremely narrowly"" and require approval from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. There could also be a medical exception, with documentation from a doctor.

WHAT WILL AMERICANS HAVE TO DO?

Americans who are unvaccinated have to show proof of a negative COVID-19 test within one day of international travel. If you're vaccinated, you need to take a test within three days of your departure, for both Americans and citizens of other countries. This does not apply to flights within the U.S.

WHO IS GOING TO ENFORCE THE VACCINE RULES?

That's up to airlines. They will have to verify vaccine records and match them against ID, and if they don't, they could face fines of up to nearly $35,000 per violation. Airlines will also collect information about passengers for contact tracing efforts. There will be CDC workers spot-checking travelers for compliance in the U.S.

WHICH VACCINES WILL LET YOU IN?

Most but not all of them . Any COVID-19 vaccine approved for emergency use by the World Health Organization, which includes the Pfizer, Moderna and Johnson & Johnson vaccines used in the U.S. as well as most used overseas, such as AstraZeneca and China's Sinovac. Not currently allowed is Russia’s Sputnik V vaccine, which is authorized in 70 countries. The WHO is reviewing Sputnik but hasn't approved it.

WHAT IF YOU DRIVE IN FROM MEXICO OR CANADA, OR TAKE A FERRY?

The land borders have only been open for ""essential"" travel. Now, anyone can come, if they're vaccinated against COVID. Be prepared to show proof of the shot to Customs and Border Protection agents. Children are exempt from the requirement.

HOW WILL THIS AFFECT TRAVEL?

While the administration is characterizing this as a reopening, some people who were technically allowed to fly to the U.S. earlier in the pandemic are now blocked because of their vaccination status. Other roadblocks to normal travel resuming are big delays in issuing U.S. visas, which people in most countries need to visit the U.S. for business and tourism, and restrictions in other countries that make travel difficult.

Even though people coming from China will now be allowed into the U.S., for example, not many are expected to travel because of restrictions at home. Before the pandemic, Chinese tourists were a lucrative market for the U.S. travel industry.

Industry experts do expect a big influx in people flying from Europe, and hope that a broader recovery in travel follows as more people globally get vaccinated, U.S. visa processing speeds up, other countries lift their own restrictions and people feel less scared about getting COVID because of travel."

The quarterback said in Friday’s interview on ""The Pat McAfee Show"" that an NFL doctor made a false claim about COVID and getting the vaccine.

""In that process, we had many conversations, I enjoyed the conversation with the league, it was good sharing, but one in particular stood out when I knew I wasn’t going to win this. I had a meeting and one of the main docs said, ‘It's impossible for a vaccinated person to get COVID or spread COVID.’ At that point, I knew that I was definitely not going to win the appeal and it was very shortly thereafter denied, which we know now that information is totally false,"" Rodgers said he was told.

An NFL spokesperson told Pro Football Talk that was untrue.

AARON RODGERS TALKS UNVACCINATED STATUS, 'WOKE MOB,' ADVICE FROM JOE ROGAN AND MLK

""No doctor from the league or the joint NFL-NFLPA infectious disease consultants communicated with the player. If they had, they certainly would have never said anything like that.""

Rodgers assailed the NFL on its COVID policies and said he didn’t believe they were based on scientific fact.

""Some of the rules, to me, are not based in science at all. They’re purely trying to out and shame people, like needing to wear a mask at a podium when every person in the room is vaccinated and wearing a mask – makes no sense to me,"" Rodgers said. ""If you got vaccinated to protect yourself from a virus I don’t have as an unvaccinated individual then why are you worried about anything I could give you?

""I have followed every single protocol to a T – minus the one I just mentioned because it actually makes no sense to me. My daily routine is the routine of an unvaccinated person.""

Rodgers told the media in August he was ""immunized"" but wasn’t presented with a follow-up question. He blamed the media for going on a ""witch hunt"" over his vaccination status.

New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy had not been expected to have a close race against Republican challenger Jack Ciattarelli, but he nearly lost, coming up with just enough votes to prevail as votes continued to be counted after Election Day had come and gone.

While Murphy's near-loss and Virginia Democrat Terry McAuliffe's defeat has been seen by some as an indicator that Americans are not in favor of current Democratic policies, Murphy claimed Sunday that his policies are exactly what kept him in office.

Murphy later addressed one area in which Democrats including President Biden have been hammered by Republicans: pandemic-related mandates.

Gov. Gavin Newsom, D-Calif., who has recently receded from public view to deal with unspecific family obligations, attended an oil heiress's wedding in San Francisco on Saturday that was officiated by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi.

Newsom has not been seen in public since abruptly canceling his trip to the COP26 climate summit in Glasgow on Oct. 29 over ""family obligations."" But KABC reported that he attended a wedding of ""long-time family friend and Getty oil heiress Ivy Love Getty."" The report said Pelosi officiated.

Their offices did not immediately respond to after-hours emails from Fox News seeking comment. The report said the wedding was ""star-studded"" and Vogue had exclusive rights on all wedding photographs. The guests were asked to leave their phones at the entrance.

Vogue reported that the bride is the great-granddaughter of J. Paul Getty and an heiress to the oil fortune. She married Tobias Alexander Engel, a photographer, at City Hall.

""Guests were asked to mask up before Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi entered the room and took her position at the microphone,"" the Vogue report said. Guests were then whisked away to the Getty Mansion to celebrate the marriage.

Daniel Lopez, a Newsom press secretary, said the governor worked at the state Capitol last week and would begin making normal appearances again sometime this week, according to a statement provided to SFGATE.

A report said the governor was planning a public appearance on Tuesday. Deadline reported that Newsom's office announced late Monday he will ""participate in a fireside chat at the 2021 California Economic Summit sponsored by California Forward.""

Lopez further explained that the governor's previous cancelation was not a result of the COVID-19 booster shot he received during his last public appearance.

""Last week, Governor Newsom worked in the Capitol with staff on urgent issues including COVID-19 vaccines for kids, boosters, ports, the forthcoming state budget and California’s continued economic recovery,"" Lopez said. ""He will have public events this week related to the economy and vaccines.""

Jennifer Siebel Newsom, the governor's wife, addressed his absence in a weekend tweet that was later deleted.

""It’s funny how certain folks can’t handle truth,"" she wrote. ""When someone cancels something, maybe they’re just in the office working; maybe in their free time they’re at home with their family, at their kids’ sports matches, or dining out with their wife. Please stop hating and get a life.""

California state senators John Laird and Bob Hertzberg reportedly bristled when asked about the governor's absence at the Glasgow conference.

A wider CDC study earlier this year found that unvaccinated Americans are 10 times more likely to get hospitalized and 11 times more likely to die from the delta variant.

The state trails the nation slightly in vaccination rates, as 66.7% of all Texans ages 5 and older have received at least one dose, while 57.9% are fully vaccinated.

The efficacy of vaccines wanes over time, which is notable because the first Texans to receive their vaccine did so about 10 months ago.

A study published last month in the Lancet medical journal found that the effectiveness of Pfizer's vaccine in preventing infection dropped from 88% to 47% six months after the second dose.

PFIZER, BIONTECH ASK FDA TO AUTHORIZE COVID-19 BOOSTERS FOR ALL ADULTS

Pfizer is currently seeking approval from the FDA for its third dose booster shot for all adults. The company said last month that in a trial of more than 10,000 people, the third-dose booster ""restored vaccine protection against COVID-19 to the high levels achieved after the second dose,"" with a vaccine efficacy of 95.6%.

The FDA already granted emergency use authorization for a third dose booster to all adults who received the single dose Johnson & Johnson vaccine, as well as the elderly and certain vulnerable adults who received the Pfizer or Moderna vaccine.

Rodgers on Friday appeared on ""The Pat McAfee Show"" and went into great length about the reasons why he’s unvaccinated and maintained he didn’t lie when he told reporters in August he was ""immunized."" The star quarterback went into a litany of detail explaining the homeopathic treatments he received, the ""research"" he brought to NFL doctors and consulting Joe Rogan about treating it.

On Monday, People reported the 2020 NFL MVP is unhappy with the further criticism he’s received.

Rodgers ""feels like he just shared his point of view, and now he's being crucified for it,"" a source told People.

""He knew some people would disagree with him, but he didn't know that it would become the s---storm it became. People who he thought were friends are turning on him.

""He's upset. He's very unhappy with the response to him.""

STATE FARM BACKS AARON RODGERS' 'PERSONAL POINT OF VIEW,' ENCOURAGES VACCINATIONS AFTER QB'S CONTROVERSY

Rodgers hasn’t spoken since his interview on ""The Pat McAfee Show."" In the interview, Rodgers took shots at the NFL media for ripping him and made it a point to say he would’ve explained himself if anyone asked him to explain what he meant when he said he was immunized. Additionally, he said he was allergic to some of the ingredients in the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines and chose not to get the Johnson & Johnson vaccine due to some of its side effects.

""I'm not an anti-vaxx, flat-earther. … I have an allergy to an ingredient that's in the mRNA vaccines. I found a long-term immunization protocol to protect myself, and I'm very proud of the research that went into that,"" the Packers star added.

Rodgers also cited concerns about the potential of becoming infertile from the vaccines, despite experts from Johns Hopkins Medicine saying COVID-19 vaccines are not linked to infertility. He said the Packers knew what his vaccination status was. He also complained about the protocols for the players.

TOM BRADY SIDESTEPS AARON RODGERS VAX QUESTION

""Some of the rules, to me, are not based in science at all. They’re purely trying to out and shame people, like needing to wear a mask at a podium when every person in the room is vaccinated and wearing a mask – makes no sense to me,"" Rodgers said. ""If you got vaccinated to protect yourself from a virus I don’t have as an unvaccinated individual then why are you worried about anything I could give you?

""I have followed every single protocol to a T – minus the one I just mentioned because it actually makes no sense to me. My daily routine is the routine of an unvaccinated person.""

Rodgers said he consulted with Rogan about alternative treatments, including ivermectin, and called him a friend. In August, the FDA warned against those infected with COVID from using ivermectin.

In addition to stating his case for not getting vaccinated, Rodgers invoked Martin Luther King Jr.

""As an aside, the great MLK said, 'You have a moral obligation to object to unjust rules and rules that made no sense.’ In my opinion, it makes no sense to me. I test every single day. Every single day,"" Rodgers said.

The Food and Drug Administration and the CDC have authorized and recommended the use of booster shots of Pfizer-BioNtech, Moderna and Johnson & Johnson vaccines for certain groups.

The FDA also signed off on ""mixing and matching"" of vaccines, which allows, for example, some individuals who received the Johnson & Johnson vaccine initially to choose to receive a booster shot of either Pfizer of Moderna.

And earlier this month the FDA and CDC authorized and recommended doses of the Pfizer vaccine for children between the ages of 5 and 11.

HUME: WHITE HOUSE URGING VACCINE MANDATE IN VIOLATION OF COURT STAY IS ‘POLITICAL DYNAMITE’

Walensky broke down what you need to know:

Many vaccinated adults are confused as to whether or not they should receive a booster. Can you explain who is eligible for a booster for each shot?

Walensky: For those who received a Johnson & Johnson vaccine, all people 18 and older who were vaccinated 2 or more months ago are eligible for a booster shot. For those who received the Pfizer or Moderna vaccine, there are several groups of people who are eligible for a booster shot 6 months or more after their primary series. These groups include those who are 65 years and older, 18 years and older who have underlying medical conditions, 18 and older who live in long-term care settings, as well as those 18 and older who live or work in high-risk settings. If you’re 6 months after your second Pfizer or Moderna vaccine, and are in one of these groups you are eligible for a booster.""

Do you recommend that those eligible receive a booster shot?

Walenksy: Vaccination continues to be the best way to protect ourselves, our families, and our communities from COVID-19. I cannot emphasize the importance of vaccination enough. I strongly recommend those who are eligible to receive a booster based on CDC recommendations get one.

PFIZER, BIONTECH ASK FDA TO AUTHORIZE COVID-19 BOOSTERS FOR ALL ADULTS

Why did your advisory panel choose not to recommend the Pfizer booster shot for many adults? What would you say to critics who'd say the panel was ""following the science""? Do you have full faith in your advisory panel?

Walenksy: The CDC Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices has among its members world-renowned scientists and medical professionals. As new data and science has emerged throughout this pandemic, this committee has continually met to put forward their individual and collective expertise and thoroughly discuss scientific evidence. I am confident in the advice and counsel they provide to the agency on matters related to the use of approved vaccines.

The FDA and CDC have discussed ""mix and match"" boosters for some adults who received the Johnson & Johnson vaccine, meaning they can now receive a Pfizer or Moderna shot. Have there been clinical trials related to this new recommendation? Have there been any side effects for patients mixing and matching vaccines?

Walensky: Some people may have a preference for the vaccine type that they originally received, because they did well with their initial series, while some may desire another. FDA’s authorizations and CDC’s recommendations allow for mix and match between the primary vaccine series and the booster shot. The most important aspect is receiving the strong protection the vaccines offer.

Do you have a message to those who are still hesitant to receive any COVID vaccines?

Walensky: All three COVID-19 vaccines authorized in the United States are safe. They are all proven to be highly effective in reducing the risk of severe disease, hospitalization, and death. If you have not yet been vaccinated, I strongly encourage you to consider the benefits of receiving a COVID-19 vaccine and to get vaccinated– not just for yourself, but also for the health and safety of your children, family, and community.

REGENERON REPORTS COVID-19 ANTIBODY COCKTAIL REDUCED INFECTION RISK BY 82% FOR 8 MONTHS — SO FAR

For those who are still unsure about getting vaccinated talk to a health professional you trust—ask question of your own doctor, pharmacist, or vaccinators in your community to get the information you need.

Will children who've received shots be required to wear masks in schools?

Walensky: Our highest priority is to ensure that children can have a safe, in person school year this year. It is proven that masks in schools work to protect our children, to keep them and their school communities safe, and to keep them in school for in-person learning, especially as large numbers of children remain unvaccinated. As we continue to vaccinate more children and adults, schools should continue to utilize the prevention measures that we know keep children safe, such as wearing masks in schools and indoor spaces, avoiding crowds and poorly ventilated spaces, and regularly washing hands. We will continue to follow evolving science, vaccination status and case rates as we provide recommendations to keep our schools safe.

Are any specific members of the Biden administration directing the CDC on how to make and enact any policies on battling COVID-19?

Walensky: We are collaborating across the whole of government and across the scientific and medical community to stay ahead of the virus and move us forward on our path out of this pandemic – to stop the spread of infection, to keep people out of the hospital, and to save as many lives as possible."

The project began this month in an effort to boost revenue for the business after the COVID-19 pandemic affected its clientele totals and to increase vaccination rates across the country.

AUSTRIA SET TO IMPOSE NATIONWIDE LOCKDOWN FOR UNVACCINATED

According to recent data provided by Our World in Data, nearly 67% of Austria's population is partially or fully vaccinated.

Daily Mail's report on the matter also stated that boys as young as 14-years-old, so long as they are with an adult, are permitted to use the clinic. The report also said women are being encouraged to visit the brothel to coordinate with Austria's equality laws.

In an interview with NBC News, Christoph Lielacher, FunPalast's chief executive, said the effort started as a clever ""marketing idea,"" but has become an ""absolutely serious"" operation.

""We have a perfect vaccination line. We have two doctors, we have nurses...We have a room where you are vaccinated and afterwards, we have a room where you can sit down or lie down, so it's not a joke. It's a perfect line for vaccination,"" he said.

Ted Cruz’s criticism of Big Bird for encouraging kids to get the coronavirus vaccine on Twitter after the ""Sesame Street"" characters participated in an informational town hall.

""Ted Cruz Street,"" as it was dubbed by ""SNL,"" featured cast member Aidy Bryant as the Texas Republican, joined by a guest list that included U.S. Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (Cecily Strong) with an AR-15 rifle, welfare cheat ""Oscar the Slouch"" (Chris Redd) and a very sick post-vaccine Big Bird (Kyle Mooney), whom the Cruz character advised to bathe in Borax. (Some social media users have suggested bathing in Borax after getting the COVID shot as a detox but the Food and Drug Administration has advised it is a potentially harmful skin and eye irritant.)

Bryant's Cruz said he had stood idly by for years while ""Sesame Street"" taught kids ""dangerous ideas like numbers and kindness. But when Big Bird told kids to get vaccinated against a deadly disease I said, ‘Enough!’""

He described ""Cruz Street"" as a gated community where kids would be safe from the ""woke"" government. And to the tune of the ""Sesame Street"" theme song, Cruz and a group of kids sang that they would ""sweep the libs away"" and ""grab an eagle and a gun"" and ""bring the gun to Cruz Street.""

Cruz explained he was mocked for calling Big Bird’s tweet ""propaganda"" last week ""simply because I am a human senator and he is an eight-foot-tall fictional bird.""

Strong's Greene came on and explained that today’s episode of ""Ted Cruz Street"" was ""brought to you by ‘Q’ – the man, not the letter."" Every episode of the actual ""Sesame Street"" is ""sponsored"" by a letter of the alphabet that features thematically in the show.

Bryant's Cruz later mentioned what he said were three more important letters – C, R and T. He explained that while they stood for ""critical race theory,"" he believed they more accurately meant ""Caucasian rights trampled.""

Joe Rogan (Pete Davidson) also made an appearance, proclaiming he ""used to host ‘Fear Factor’ and now doctors fear me.""

Later, Cruz raised the topic of the Democrats' social safety-net bill.

""Did somebody say free money?"" Oscar the Slouch said, rising from inside his trash-can home.

Oscar told Cruz that ""Papa Joe Biden gave me so many stimulus I decided to quit working and live in this trash can. Now you all work hard and Biden gives me your money."" He added that he proudly uses ""your tax money on drugs and pornography.""

At the end of the sketch, Cruz said the word of the day was ""freedom"" and Britney Spears (Chloe Fineman) came on to celebrate her emancipation from her conservancy – and to tell the audience ""Live from New York, it’s Saturday Night!""

""None of these mitigating factors are stopping Republicans from exploiting the painful cost-of-living increases and prices at the pumps to slam ‘Bidenflation’ and to argue that the President's ambitious political program is squandering past economic gains,"" Collinson wrote in the section titled, ""Republicans Pounce.""

The CNN analysis then focused on GOP lawmakers who have dared to criticize the rising cost of living under Biden.

""A new CNN fact check contradicts claims by Republicans that rising prices are solely caused by wasteful Democratic spending. Many factors, including supply chain chaos and production limits by OPEC countries, are factoring into a complicated situation,"" Collinson wrote.

A federal judge overturned Gov. Greg Abbott's executive order banning mask mandates in Texas schools Wednesday, citing a violation of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA).

U.S. District Court Judge Lee Yeakel barred Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton from enforcing Abbott’s order, which follows months of legal wrangling between parents and the state regarding whether the governor's order violates the ADA, according to The Texas Tribune.

""The spread of COVID-19 poses an even greater risk for children with special health needs,"" Yeakel said. ""Children with certain underlying conditions who contract COVID-19 are more likely to experience severe acute biological effects and to require admission to a hospital and the hospital’s intensive-care unit.""

The judge's ruling now allows local officials to make their own rules regarding mask mandates.

The advocacy group Disability Rights Texas filed the federal lawsuit against Abbott in August on behalf of several families in the state. The suit, which also named Paxton and Texas Education Agency Commissioner Mike Morath, argued that that executive order denies public education to children who are at high risk from the virus.

Kym Davis Rogers, who represented Disability Rights Texas, noted that the court ruled that Texas is not above federal law.

""No student should be forced to make the choice of forfeiting their education or risking their health, and now they won’t have to,"" Rogers said.

Abbott's ban on school mask mandates echoes that of Gov. Ron DeSantis, R-Fla., who has repeatedly clashed with the Biden administration over the issue.

DeSantis signed an executive order in July that made mask-wearing optional in public schools, despite updated mask guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention that recommends all teachers and students to mask up, regardless of whether they have been vaccinated."

Arrest affidavits for Lehua Kalua, 43, and husband Isaac ""Sonny"" Kalua, 52, filed Friday reveal harrowing new details leading up to the disappearance of their adoptive daughter, Isabella ""Ariel"" Kalua. The couple reported the girl had gone missing from her bedroom Sept. 13, prompting a massive community-wide search. Now investigators believe she was killed nearly a month before.

The girl’s body has not been found, and the Honolulu Police Department and FBI investigators were searching the couple’s home and the Pearl Harbor Naval Ship Yard, where Isaac works, last week.

HAWAII ADOPTIVE PARENTS WHO REPORTED DAUGHTER, 6, MISSING NOW CHARGED WITH MURDER

Surveillance video obtained from the Kalua’s home on Puha Street in Waimanalo shows Ariel alive on Aug. 18, according to the affidavits. One of Ariel’s biological sisters, identified in court documents only as I.M.K., who is 11 or 12 years old, told investigators Lehua and Isaac asked her to keep a secret about what happened to her missing 6-year-old sibling two months ago.

In a recorded interview conducted Nov. 5 by Det. Shayne Iwamoto, the sister said she knows Ariel is dead ""because she was there."" According to the girl’s account, Lehua had woken her up around 3:30 a.m. one morning, and they both went to check on Ariel in the bathroom. The sister observed that Ariel ""did not wake up"" and had ""duct tape on her nose and mouth and was not breathing"" inside a dog cage.

Lehua then filled the bathtub with water and put Ariel inside to see if she would wake up, but ""it did not work,"" the affidavit says. The sister then had to help carry Ariel to a bedroom. She did not see what happened to Ariel because she was told to go back to bed as Lehua and Isaac stayed up.

Lehua then drained the tub. A few days later, the sister said, Isaac went to a hospital to ""pretend"" he had COVID-19. The girl stated she knew Isaac was pretending because she knows that he took off work to ""help mom,"" the affidavit says, ""to get rid of the stuff … evidence.""

The affidavit says Isaac told investigators he went to work Aug. 19, was scheduled to be off on Aug. 20 and woke up feeling ill Aug. 20. He went to an emergency room, where he was treated for possible COVID-19 symptoms. He said he took off work for the next two weeks because of the hospital visit.

The family did not own a dog at the time, and Lehua had purchased the dog cage online because Ariel ""would sneak around at night and want to eat because she was hungry,"" the affidavit says. The sister said she would sometimes sneak Ariel food because Lehua would not feed her. But Lehua ""would catch them and become upset,"" so the adoptive mother started keeping Ariel inside the cage at night.

Lehua put duct tape on Ariel ""plenty of times"" because the girl would ""sneak around and eat,"" according to the affidavits. The sister said she believed the duct tape came from Isaac’s job, adding he had seen both her and Ariel ""tied up with duct tape on other occasions and did nothing,"" according to the affidavit.

The affidavit says Officer Joel Patterson first responded at about 6:25 a.m. on Sept. 13 to the home on Puha Street in Waimanalo, where he was greeted by Lehua, who identified herself as the girls’ adoptive mother. Lehua told the officer that she hadn’t seen her daughter since about 9 p.m. the night before when putting the girl to bed.

Lehua claimed to have woken the next day to notice the side door of the house was open. In the past, Lehua said, her daughter sometimes would go to the garage unnoticed and fall asleep there. The woman also claimed the girl was known to open windows and leave doors unlocked and said the door sensor was activated at about 1:30 a.m. Lehua said the family had a camera system installed but it constantly crashes and goes on and off.

The affidavit identifies the missing girl’s biological parents as Melanie Joseph and Adam Sellers, who are homeless and live in the Waimanalo. Investigators located Joseph on Sept. 13, and she claimed to have no knowledge of the girl’s whereabouts. Sellers, meanwhile, was living at a residential treatment facility at the time.

The Kaluas had adopted three of Joseph and Sellers’ biological children, including Ariel, and were foster parents to a fourth child of the same couple born in 2020.

The adoptive parents were arrested Wednesday and are being held without bail. The Kaluas appeared Friday before Family Court Judge Linda Martell at Honolulu District Court via video conference from a courthouse cell block, the Honolulu Star Advertiser reported. State Public Defender James Tabe entered not guilty pleas for them. He said if they both qualify for public defenders, one of them will have a private attorney appointed.

An attorney who has acted as the Kalua's spokesperson, William Harrison, told The Associated Press he is not representing them in the case but has spoken on their behalf as a family friend.

""All I can say is I’m obviously saddened by what’s written,"" he said of the court filing. ""I don’t know the details.""

During a news conference announcing the arrests of the Kaluas, police declined comment on why they believed Isabella is dead. The timing of the sister's interview last Friday with the detective coincides with Honolulu Police homicide Lt. Deena Thoemmes saying the case turned into a murder investigation at the end of last week.

During Bryan's opening monologue, he pointed out that the awards show was not taking place over video conference because everyone was ""immunized."" The comment seemed to be a jab at Green Bay Packers quarterback Aaron Rodgers who just tested positive for COVID-19. Rodgers admitted he was unvaccinated after initially telling the press he was ""immunized.""

""We’re following all the health protocols to keep everyone safe and it’s so great to be here with all my fellow artists, tested and together,"" Bryan said. ""Or immunized? Who is it? Just playin’!""

Underwood's husband, former pro hockey star Mike Fisher, supported Rodgers' decision to not get the vaccine in a long post on social media.

""I believe in the freedom to choose what we put in our bodies and the freedom of conscience. I agree with him in that the science clearly shows the vaccinated spread covid at basically the same rate as the unvaccinated,"" Fisher wrote on Instagram.

After Bryan told the joke, the camera panned to Underwood who gave a lot of ""side-eye."" Her reaction quickly went viral on Twitter.

""Great @carrieunderwood side eye,"" said one viewer.

""Carrie Underwood looked quite annoyed when they showed her in the audience,"" wrote one person.

Another person explained, ""No he was making a coy joke about the Aaron Rodger's issue...that's why the camera panned to Carrie Underwood because her husband has been publicly supporting Rodgers.""

""We’re only ten minutes into the #CMAawards and my favourite part of the show will be Luke Bryan talking about being immunized and then panning to Carrie Underwood after Mike Fisher’s vaccine comments this week,"" said one viewer.

Wrote another, ""Carrie's hubby supporting Aaron Rogers LOL"" after someone commented that it was an ""extremely awkward opening.""

Underwood never commented publicly about her husband's post.

In August, the star caught backlash for liking a tweet opposing mask mandates for children.

Underwood, a mother of two young boys herself, appeared to have liked a video on Twitter shared by media personality Matt Walsh containing a video of a speech that he gave railing against such mandates.

Former President Trump in remarks at the National Republican Congressional Committee dinner Monday openly blasted the 13 congressional Republicans who supported President Biden’s infrastructure bill in a vote Friday.

Fox News Digital has confirmed from sources at the dinner that the former president criticized the 13 Republican defectors in a lengthy speech Monday night in a room where at least one of them, Rep. Nicole Malliotakis, was present.

MEET THE 13 REPUBLICANS WHO VOTED FOR THE INFRASTRUCTURE BILL

The House of Representatives voted 228-206 on Friday to pass the $1.2 trillion infrastructure bill , which could not have passed without the support of the 13 Republicans who pushed it through despite opposition from six progressive Democratic members of the House.

The Republicans who supported the bill, arguing that it provided funding for important infrastructure projects in their districts, were Adam Kinzinger of Illinois, Don Bacon of Nebraska, Don Young of Alaska, John Katko of New York, Tom Reed of New York, Andrew Garbarino of New York, Malliotakis of New York, Brian Fitzpatrick of Pennsylvania, Chris Smith of New Jersey, Jeff Van Drew of New Jersey, Fred Upton of Michigan, Anthony Gonzalez of Ohio, and David McKinley of West Virginia.

The New York Post’s Juliegrace Brufke reported on Tuesday that Malliotakis was ""visibly shaken"" by Trump’s remarks.

Malliotakis explained her vote in a video posted on social media, saying that the bill is ""incredibly good"" for her district and is different from the ""socialist spending spree.""

GOP LAWMAKERS BLAST 'RINOS' AFTER HOUSE PASSES $1.2T INFRASTRUCTURE BILL: 'TIME TO NAME NAMES'

Several of the other Republicans released similar statements, including Bacon, who said the bill will make the nation ""stronger.""

""Most of the hard infrastructure bill is paid for by unspent COVID money that was already appropriated by Congress. This bill makes our nation stronger and more competitive for years to come,"" Bacon said in a statement. ""Make no mistake. This is not the Bernie Sanders’ Socialist Budget Busting Bill, which would’ve cost American taxpayers their hard-earned money. When that bill does come to the floor for a vote, I will be a hard ‘NO.’""

Several House Republicans have sided with Trump and expressed outrage toward the 13 Republicans, and sources confirmed to Fox News Digital that GOP leadership is concerned that disgruntled GOP lawmakers will attempt to strip committee assignments from the lawmakers who supported the bill.

""RINOS just passed this wasteful $1.2 trillion dollar ‘infrastructure’ bill,"" Republican Rep. Lauren Boebert tweeted. ""Pelosi did not have the votes in her party to pass this garbage. Time to name names and hold these fake republicans accountable.""

Republican Rep. Madison Cawthorn called for any Republican who supported the bill to be primaried during their next election.

Kinzinger, Reed and Gonzalez have announced they plan to retire at the end of their terms.

Punch Bowl News reported that the Twitter account for the House GOP Conference tweeted and then deleted a post on Friday saying, ""A vote for the Democrats ‘infrastructure’ bill is a vote for their socialist wish list. Americans won’t forget.""

That tweet reportedly angered some of the Republicans who supported the bill, including Fitzpatrick.

On Tuesday, the actress took to her Instagram Stories where she criticized a report alleging the 37-year-old stepped out in Los Angeles following his COVID-19 diagnosis. The 29-year-old claimed Rodgers isn’t the masked man who was photographed by paparazzi.

""Literally ya'll need to calm the f--- down,"" Woodley wrote alongside the photos in question. ""This is straight up HILARIOUS. News outlets STILL grasping at straws to disparage Aaron. Finding random f---ing men on the streets of LA and saying its him.""

""I know Aaron's body VERY well,"" she continued. ""First off his feet, ahem and no offense to this rando dude, are a LOT bigger. Also, for those of us who know Aaron beyond the worlds of obsessed sport and s---- media, it's no secret he has the hairiest hands on the f---ing planet. This oblivious homie. Clearly, does not (go ahead, zoom in).""

AARON RODGERS FINDS DEFENDER IN EX-NHL STAR MIKE FISHER: 'IT’S ABOUT CONTROL OVER OUR LIVES'

""Also, cute car dude, but Aaron would never drive this,"" she added.

On Nov. 9, a Wisconsin health care organization ended their nine-year partnership with the Green Bay Packers star after he detailed his reasoning for avoiding the three COVID-19 vaccinations endorsed by the NFL.

A statement posted on Twitter by Prevea Health said the company and Rodgers mutually agreed to end their partnership, effective Saturday. Prevea Health and Rodgers had been partners since 2012.

The statement said Prevea Health ""remains deeply committed to protecting its patients, staff, providers and communities amidst the COVID-19 pandemic. This includes encouraging and helping all eligible populations to become vaccinated against COVID-19 to prevent the virus from further significantly impacting lives and livelihoods.""

The move comes a day after Rodgers told ""The Pat McAfee Show"" he had sought alternative treatments to COVID-19 vaccination because he is allergic to an ingredient in two of the FDA-approved shots. Rodgers did not say what ingredient he was allergic to, or how he knows he is allergic.

Rodgers has strongly questioned the NFL’s COVID-19 protocols, along with any organization forcing health requirements on individuals.

""I believe strongly in bodily autonomy and the ability to make choices for your body, not to have to acquiesce to some woke culture or crazed group of individuals who say you have to do something,"" he said. ""Health is not a one size fits all for everybody, and for me, it involved a lot of study in the offseason.""

The COVID-19 vaccines authorized for use in the U.S. were tested in tens of thousands of people and proven to be both safe and effective at dramatically reducing the risk of serious disease and death, The Associated Press reported.

The outlet noted that the vaccines now have been given to more than 200 million Americans and that real-world use plus extra government safety tracking have made clear that serious side effects are extremely rare — and that any risk is far lower than the risks posed by COVID-19.

Rodgers, who has been tested daily as part of NFL protocols for unvaccinated players, found out he contracted COVID-19 on Wednesday. He must have a negative test to return to the team on Nov. 13.

The reigning NFL MVP, whose endorsement deals include a starring role in commercials for insurance company State Farm, hinted that his stance on vaccination could have consequences when he described himself as a victim of ""cancel culture.""

Rodgers and Woodley’s relationship became public earlier this year. On Feb. 6, the athlete revealed their engagement during the virtual NFL Honors broadcast. In late February, Woodley confirmed their engagement during an appearance on ""The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon.""

Rubin, who was invited to speak at the National Conservative conference in Orlando last week, has come a long way from his days as a ""liberal lefty"" on the progressive news outlet The Young Turks and a 2016 supporter of Sen. Bernie Sanders and now identifies, though a bit tongue in cheek, as a ""far-right, crazy, freedom-loving American conservative, libertarian maniac.""

""I started waking up to some of the stuff that we all now see as very obvious,"" Rubin told Fox News. ""I started saying, 'Hey, we on the left, why are we shouting everybody down at college campuses? Why are we calling everybody racist? Why are we calling everybody homophobes? They can't all be Nazis. We're not making arguments. We're just using these labels on people and that's not- that's not what I thought liberalism was about. In essence, liberalism actually isn't about that. I mean, that's the dirty secret amongst conservatives is that there is a difference between leftism and true classical liberalism, which is about individual rights and laissez-faire economics and things of that nature.""

DAVE RUBIN PROVIDES RECEIPTS FROM NEWS ORGS BACKING UP CLAIM TWITTER SUSPENDED HIM OVER ‘TRUE’ INFO

Rubin expressed ""what really changed"" him was how conservative icons he once viewed as ""the bad guys"" like commentators Dennis Prager, Larry Elder and Ben Shapiro, as well as Republican lawmakers like Sens. Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio, were actually ""pretty decent"" people who were ""willing to have that conversation"" despite any political disagreements they may have.

""I'm actually thrilled to be here because I think what's happening here at the National Conservatism conference is that people are saying, 'Hey, we've got old school liberals, we've got libertarians, we have, say, religious conservatives,' but can these people all exist In a political movement? I think they can. That's really the challenge of the conference,"" Rubin said.

The ""Rubin Report"" host railed against the media and its ""love"" for Big Tech censorship since it's ""protecting their narrative.""

""The people on CNN are not journalists. And you really need to understand that. Don Lemon and Chris Cuomo and Wolf Blitzer and Anderson Cooper and the rest of them are not journalists. They're all Democrats, obviously. That's not a controversial statement,"" Rubin told Fox News. ""They're Democrats who basically launder Democrat and lefty talking points through the media, they launder the lies and they present it as truth. So the reason they're okay with the censorship is they don't like the other narrative getting out there.""

DAVE RUBIN FIRES BACK AT TWITTER FOR LOCKING ACCOUNT ON 'HARMFUL' COVID TWEET: 'THEY'RE COMING FOR EVERYBODY'

Rubin himself was the subject of Big Tech censorship over the summer when Twitter locked his account over a tweet that correctly predicted the implementation of federal vaccine mandates and decrying booster shots despite how COVID continues to spread among the vaccinated, writing ""A sane society would take a pause. We do not live in a sane society.""

After accusing him of ""spreading misleading and potentially harmful information related to COVID-19,"" Twitter later admitted its crackdown of Rubin was an ""error"" following intense backlash.

""They want to control the narrative and if you get information out before they want you to get it out, you're in trouble,"" Rubin said.

Rubin expressed his battle against Twitter reaffirmed why he created Locals, a content-sharing platform that recently merged with the video-sharing platform Rumble, declaring the partnership the ""first real tangible move against Big Tech.""

""Rumble has incredible, incredible infrastructure, the underbelly of the Internet to really compete with Amazon, AWS, so websites can't get blown off the internet the way Parler was after January 6. Locals- we built it from the ground up… What we're trying to do- and the reason these two companies came together, is we want to create a parallel ecosystem,"" Rubin told Fox News. ""I'm not saying Twitter shouldn't exist. I'm not saying YouTube shouldn't exist. Let them exist, but they're censoring us, we know all the things they're doing… So we're just gonna create better products… So we are going to build a parallel ecosystem that treats speech more fairly, that we're going to try to be as transparent about our policies as possible. And I think this is really the first chance that we've had to stop this Big Tech onslaught.""

J.D. VANCE SAYS ELITISM HAS ERODED THE MEDIA: CNN ‘FUNDAMENTALLY LOOKS DOWN’ ON AVERAGE AMERICANS

Regarding whether or not Congress has a role in the censorship debate, which he referred to as the ""million-dollar question,"" Rubin believes that ""human ingenuity and technology is the answer"" but also the Big Tech companies have become ""so massive"" and ""unbelievably powerful,"" the government at the very least can ""make sure that we have a free market so that competition can exist.""

However, he did admit that the government is ""not really good at anything"" so the idea of its involvement ""isn't great.""

""I would prefer to do it with new technology and new ideas, but I think there's a very healthy debate there and I think you can make arguments a little more for intervention, that would be just fine, too,"" Rubin said.

Rubin, who has no relation to Washington Post columnist Jennifer Rubin, tore into the media's transformation during the Trump era, noting how it was ""a little hard to see how partisan they were"" but that the 45th president ""unmasked everybody"" and ""caused these people to just fall on their own sword"" and expose themselves as ""Democratic operatives.""

""All the media has to be is not horrible. They don't have to be great. Nobody expects them to be great. Just don't be horrible, but they cannot stop. They cannot stop themselves,"" Rubin said. ""So I think what Trump did was expose the whole thing. And now because of that exposure, now that's why we have such tension between the online media and the mainstream media because it's obvious and it's out there and we are… we're battling for truth. And I believe the truth will set you free…. So I believe we're on the side of truth and I think I have great hope that we can keep winning intellectually, at least for now. And then maybe that will work its way into the culture and into the political system.""

When asked if the media has gotten any better under President Biden, Rubin replied, ""It's even worse.""

""Everyone knows there's something cognitively wrong with Biden. They refuse to cover it on mainstream media. They run cover for his ridiculous press conferences where they lie about everything. And let's be very clear: if Donald Trump was using the federal government to demand that companies and the federal government itself force people to be vaccinated, every single person who is for vaccine mandates right now would be screaming that this is Nazi-style assault on freedom,"" Rubin said. ""So that's what I mean. Trump exposed them and now they're all going for it… You don't have to dislike [Biden] as much as me but if you were just an average person, you might say, 'Hey, you know, supply chain problems, gas price problems, food problems, Afghanistan- a bit of a disaster. We don't talk about that anymore.' But there's just no criticism because he's their guy."""

Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis of Florida spotlighted his conservative credentials, touted his achievements in office and pledged to continue his fight as he addressed the annual leadership meeting of the Republican Jewish Coalition, a major conference of party leaders, activists and mega-donors.

""In the state of Florida, I am walking that line. I am standing my ground. I’m not backing down,"" DeSantis emphasized as he spoke Saturday on the third day of the Las Vegas conference. ""We’ve done an awful lot in the state of Florida. We have a lot more to do, and I have only begun to fight.""

The conservative governor has seen his popularity surge among Republican voters in his state and around the nation over the past year and a half, thanks in large part to his combative pushback against COVID-19 restrictions amid the coronavirus pandemic.

And he took aim Saturday at President Biden’s efforts to increase the nation’s vaccination rate through mandates.

CRUZ CALLS 2021 ELECTIONS ‘ENORMOUSLY CONSEQUENITAL' - DOESN'T RULE OUT 2024 RUN

""We have to stand right now against these Biden mandates,"" the governor stressed. ""He does not have the constitutional authority to do what he’s trying to do, and if he can get away with this — trust me — you haven’t seen nothing yet.""

""No mandates, no restrictions, we are going to take our freedom back, and we have to do that right now,"" DeSantis said to applause.

DeSantis, a former congressman who was narrowly elected Florida governor in 2018, isn’t expected to face as challenging a reelection fight. Florida used to be the nation’s toughest general election battleground, but it has increasingly trended red over the past couple of cycles.

""We have a number-one ranked public university system five years running by U.S. News and World Report,"" DeSantis noted, also touting the Sunshine State’s creation of new jobs.

He also showcased his conservative achievements.

""I’ve appointed five constitutionalists to the Florida Supreme Court. We took the court from being the most liberal court in the United States to now being the most conservative state supreme court in the United States,"" the governor said.

And he noted his efforts to ban sanctuary cities, suing the Biden administration over what he called the president’s ""reckless border policies,"" signing multiple bills tightening voter accessibility rules and banning the teaching of critical race theory.

DeSantis also took aim at elements in the far left of the Democratic Party over its lukewarm support for Israel, charging that ""the woke are anti-Semitic. They are anti-Israel,"" which drew loud applause from the audience.

HERE COMES THE FIRST MAJOR 2024 GOP PRESIDENTIAL CATTLE CALL

DeSantis was one of eight prominent Republicans speaking at the four-day confab that pundits view as potential 2024 GOP presidential hopefuls.

Former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley, who served as U.S. ambassador to the United Nations under President Donald Trump, also spoke.

In a foreign policy-centric speech, Haley blasted the current president, arguing, ""You cannot count on the Biden Administration to stop the Iranian nuclear program.""

And she claimed that ""the Biden team wants to get back into the business of giving hundreds of millions of dollars to the Palestinians and promoting a two-state solution.""

Haley charged that ""the Palestinian leadership has never viewed the peace process as a way of achieving peace with Israel. They have always viewed it as a way to destroy Israel.""

""My promise to you is that I will always be the loud and proud ambassador in support of the United States and Israel,"" she pledged.

Haley also pointed to the high policy stakes in the 2022 midterm elections, when the GOP aims to win back majorities in the U.S. House of Representatives and the Senate.

""Those elections are about whether we stop socialism, defend our border, return to fiscal sanity and end liberal indoctrination in our schools. And yes, they are also about standing strong for our best ally in the Middle East,"" she said. ""Join me in fighting for victory in 2022."""

LOS ANGELES—Jennifer Siebel Newsom, the wife of Gov. Gavin Newsom, took to Twitter Monday night to promote an upcoming movie but commenters seemed to be more interested in the whereabouts of her husband, who has not made a public appearance in 12 days.

Siebel Newsom, an award-winning filmmaker, posted about a new project called ""Fair Play,"" which will investigate domestic inequity. But responses to the post largely focused on her husband and what many see as a mystery surrounding his absence from the public eye.

""Where’s our Governor @GavinNewsom? Post video if he’s alive and okay,"" one commenter posted.

Others asked why she deleted a post from the night before that seemed to address the issue. The post was screengrabbed by Sophia Bollag, a reporter for the Sacramento Bee, and said ""certain folks can't handle truth.""

""When someone cancels something, maybe they’re just in the office working; maybe in their free time they’re at home with their family, at their kids’ sports matches, or dining out with their wife. Please stop hating and get a life,"" the since-deleted tweet read.

Newsom’s office did not immediately respond to an after-hours email from Fox News.

ABC 7 reported that Newsom attended a wedding in San Francisco Saturday for ""long-time family friend and Getty oil heiress Ivy Love Getty."" The report said House Speaker Nancy Pelosi officiated.

Daniel Lopez, his press secretary, said the governor worked at the state Capitol last week and would begin making normal appearances again sometime this week, according to a statement provided to SFGATE. Lopez further explained that the governor's cancelation was not a result of the COVID-19 booster shot he received during his last public appearance.

""Last week Governor Newsom worked in the Capitol with staff on urgent issues including COVID-19 vaccines for kids, boosters, ports, the forthcoming state budget and California’s continued economic recovery,"" Lopez said. ""He will have public events this week related to the economy and vaccines.""

The AP reported that it is a relatively slow time in Sacramento as the state Legislature is not in session and won’t meet again until January.

Recent storms mean no major wildfires are burning out of control, as has been the case in recent years. Newsom is reportedly dealing with unspecific family obligations.

A recent USA Today/Suffolk University survey showed a 37.8% approval rating for Biden with a 59% disapproval – more than 21 points underwater. Forty-six percent of those included in the survey said Biden has done a worse job than expected, and 64% said they don't want Biden to run for reelection.

Congressional Democrats, meanwhile, may face an uphill battle to preserve their razor-thin majorities unless something significant changes before Election Day on Nov. 8, 2022. The USA Today/Suffolk University poll gives Republicans a 46%-to-38% advantage on a generic congressional ballot.

Biden, who was the oldest president to ever take the presidential oath, will turn 79 later this month and said earlier this year that he plans to run for reelection.

""My plan is to run for reelection. That’s my expectation,"" Biden told reporters in March.

He later pushed back against a reporter’s suggestion that his 2024 plans were definite.

On Saturday, the governor sparked further criticism after reportedly attending an oil heiress’ wedding officiated by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., after more than a week of no public appearances.

During his first appearance since the backlash on Tuesday, Newsom said at the California Economic Summit that he canceled his trip to go trick-or-treating with his kids and assuage his dad guilt.

""It’s been a hell of a couple years for all of us, for each and every one of you, particularly parents,"" he said. ""The fits and starts at school, the stresses of balancing your responsibilities at work and also your responsibilities at home. And I extend those responsibilities particularly to fathers, that may not be doing as much, let’s be honest, as the moms have been doing these last few years.""

""I’ve been on this damn treadmill,"" he continued. ""We’ve gone from crisis to crisis, from wildfires and extremes, from droughts and social justice and unrest, obviously with COVID, this recall you may have read about.""

Newsom said he was out to dinner with his family when his children held an ""intervention"" because they ""couldn’t believe I was going to miss Halloween."" He ultimately decided to stay home because the ""knot"" in his stomach was too much to bear.

""I had no damn choice, I had to cancel that trip,"" he said.

Yes, COVID-19 boosters use the same recipe as the original shots, despite the emergence of the more contagious delta variant. The vaccines weren't tweaked to better match delta because they're still working well.

The vaccines work by training your body to recognize and fight the spike protein that coats the coronavirus and helps it invade the body’s cells. Delta’s mutations fortunately weren’t different enough to escape detection.

The increased protection you might get from a booster adjusted to better match the delta or other variants would be marginal, says Dr. Paul Goepfert, director of the Alabama Vaccine Research Clinic at the University of Alabama at Birmingham.

Manufacturing doses with a new formula would have also delayed the rollout of boosters.

Moderna and Pfizer are studying boosters tweaked for the delta and other variants to be ready if one's ever needed. Health authorities would have to decide if and when a vaccine formula swap would be worthwhile.

As of Wednesday, the state had nearly 1,254 hospitalizations, with 80% made up of unvaccinated COVID-19 patients, according to the Colorado health department’s data dashboard. That state data indicates that 30% of state hospital facilities are anticipating ICU bed shortages in the next week. Colorado is also struggling with a staffing shortage for hospitals.



On top of dealing with the surge of coronavirus cases, hospitals are stretched thin as new admissions are filling beds for health concerns many patients put off during the span of the pandemic, such as overdoses, mental health/psych issues, suicide attempts, heart attacks and strokes.



Nationwide, 18% of hospital workers have quit their jobs since 2020, and another 12% have been laid off.



Before the pandemic, the industry was short 300,000 workers. Now, hospitals lack nearly 2 million.

The staffing shortage has it difficult to reactivate COVID overflow facilities just when flu season is approaching, Dr. Eric Hill, the EMS director at The Medical Center of Aurora, told The Denver Channel.

Also on Wednesday, the Colorado Hospital Association moved into Tier 3, the highest tier available, to manage patient transfers as hospital capacity concerns grow due to COVID-19.

The CHA said the Combined Hospital Transfer Center was re-activated in August to Tier 1 when COVID-19 hospitalizations started to increase.



Democratic Gov. Jared Polis issued two executive orders on Sunday in response to the strain on the state’s hospital system. One order calls for additional National Guard resources and the other orders hospitals and emergency departments to transfer or stop admitting new patients due to the lack of hospital beds.

Researchers involved with the Arizona case study found a pet parent and two pets all were infected with the identical strain of coronavirus known as B.1.575, an early version of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, the authors said in a news release.

This study is one of five nationwide pilot studies investigating COVID infections in animals. The release stated the study is the only one using whole genomic sequence, a laboratory method that looks at genetic makeup, of the virus from samples of humans and pets.

""This is the first report of the B.1.575 lineage in companion animals. Genetically linking SARS-CoV-2 between people and animals, and tracking changes in SARS-CoV-2 genomes is essential to detect any cross-species SARS-CoV-2 transmission that may lead to more transmissible or severe variants that can affect humans"", the authors wrote.

Genetic samples were collected from swabs of a cat and dog and their owner. The genetic makeup of the virus detected were found to match identically, suggesting zoonotic transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from human to at least one pet, according to the report. The study authors said both animals were asymptomatic but were in close contact to the symptomatic pet owner who tested positive for COVID -19.

According to the article, the owner was in close contact with both pets engaging in activities such as petting and cuddling the animals, walking the dog and cleaning the cat’s litter box, while displaying symptoms of COVID19. The dog and cat frequently sat on the owner’s lap, slept in the same bed and during the home visit, researchers observed the cat and dog stayed in close contact with each other, the authors noted in the report.

""This case study was the first example we had from the project that demonstrated the likelihood of virus transmission from a pet owner to animals in the household,"" Hayley Yaglom, lead author of the study and TGen Epidemiologist stated in the release.

The researchers stated there is no current evidence that companion animals play a role in spreading COVID 19 to humans. However, they did state that there have been reports of the coronavirus transmitting from infected people to animals.

The TGEN case study pointed out that although there are limited studies that have compared viral genome data of pets with owners, this report provides genetic evidence of virus transmission from the infected pet owner to pets, identified through whole genome sequencing.

""This is a great example of using genomics to gain intelligence about pathogens,"" David Engelthaler, Ph.D., director of TGen’s Pathogen and Microbiome Division in the news release. He added, ""This study shows that we can not only use genomics to help track COVID variants across the globe, but we can also use this technology to track exact transmissions, and in this case transmission from pet owners to pets.""

Dr. Robin Sturtz, a Veterinarian and Director of Veterinary Technology at Long Island University Post in New York, was not part of the study, but commented to Fox News that based on contact tracing it has been reported that humans can pass the virus to companion animals on very rare occasion.

Sturtz tells Fox News, ""It is encouraging to see that the study of COVID-19 transmission is being formalized and categorized on a genetic identity basis.

Sturtz also recommended, ""People getting vaccinated protects their pets, as does keeping your distance from them if you are sick.""

""Everyone can use a little more money around the holidays but most importantly we want our kids and our families to be safe,"" New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio said in a statement.

The new policy will apply to New York City-run vaccine sites and comes two days after the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention approved Pfizer's COVID-19 vaccine for emergency use for children 5-11-years-old.

SAN FRANCISCO WILL REQUIRE CHILDREN AGES 5-11 SHOW PROOF OF VACCINE TO ACCESS BUSINESSES

The mayor said that getting the vaccine now will allow children to be fully vaccinated before Christmas, hoping that the $100 incentive will drive people to show up and get extra money for holidays.

The city is hoping to speed its effort to get kids vaccinated before they travel for the holidays, noting that the updated CDC guidance says that children have to wait three weeks between Pfizer doses, even though the dosage is smaller than the adult dose.

The mayor also said that every public school in the city that serves children in the targeted age range will hold a dedicated vaccination day for those students beginning next week, which will cover about 1,070 sites over the course of the week by hitting roughly 200 schools per day.

The city stressed that parents should be present to give verbal consent, whether at a school site or a city-run site, for their children to receive the shot, though de Blasio noted that parents and guardians can also give verbal consent over the phone.

""All choices are good choices, but we want to make it available and easy for parents who prefer just to go to their local school building,"" de Blasio said.

While millions of doses of the Pfizer vaccine have already been shipped around the country in advance of the guidance, pediatricians in the city say they have not been overwhelmed by calls for appointments for kids to get the shot.

GROWING EVIDENCE LINKS COVID-19, HEARING LOSS, RESEARCHERS SAY

Observing 10 COVID-19 patients with ear-related symptoms like hearing loss, vestibular dysfunction and tinnitus, the researchers said they had found a pattern of inner ear infection consistent with symptoms after developing some of the first human cellular models of infectious inner ear disease.

Using hard-to-get adult human inner ear tissue, the group found that both human and mouse inner ear cells have the ""molecular machinery to allow SARS-CoV-2 entry.""

The virus could enter the ears using the eustachian tube, which connects the nose to the middle ear, or escape the nose through small openings surrounding the olfactory nerves, according to Konstantina Stankovic, a former Harvard Medical School associate professor and former chief of otology and neurotology at Massachusetts Eye and Ear.

Stankovic, who co-led the study, told MIT News that the virus could enter the brain space and infect cranial nerves, including the one that connects to the inner ear.

Furthermore, the researchers said that the infectious disease could infect hair cells and Schwann cells in the inner ear by using confocal microscopy.

""Our findings suggest that inner ear infection may be a significant cause of COVID-19-associated problems with hearing and balance,"" they wrote.

Still, the overall percentage of COVID-19 patients with ear-related issues is unknown.

""Initially this was because routine testing was not readily available for patients who were diagnosed with [COVID-19], and also, when patients were having more life-threatening complications, they weren’t paying much attention to whether their hearing was reduced or whether they had tinnitus,"" Stankovic said.

The doses are about one-third of the dose given to adolescents and adults.

While Moderna and Johnson & Johnson vaccines are still being tested for children ages 5-11, last month the FDA affirmed results from Pfizer showing that its two-dose shot was nearly 91% effective at preventing symptomatic infection in young children.

CDC DIRECTOR WALENSKY SIGNS OFF ON PFIZER VACCINE FOR CHILDREN 5 TO 11

While the Pfizer trial had some post-shot reactions, including sore arms and fatigue, 5- to 11-year-olds were less likely to have fevers and the FDA found no safety concerns.

Pfizer has said that it expects to make 19,000 shipments, or about 11 million doses, in the next several days. Millions more will be available to order on a weekly basis.

Although children are less likely to suffer severe COVID-19 infections, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) Director Dr. Anthony Fauci notes that the delta variant infects kids and spreads ""just as readily"" as in adults.

Since the pandemic began, at least 94 children have died from COVID-19, more than 8,300 have been hospitalized and over 5,000 have developed a serious inflammatory condition linked to COVID-19. Black and Latino children, as well as those with chronic conditions, are disproportionately affected by the virus.

Multisystem inflammatory syndrome can hit kids several weeks after recovery from even a mild infection, as well as ""long COVID.""

In addition, heart inflammation has occurred mostly in young men or teen boys, usually after the second dose – though patients tend to recover quickly. Doctors say COVID-19 infection can cause more serious heart inflammation.

Children who have already been infected by COVID-19 should still receive vaccinations once they've recovered, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).

While prior infection provides some protection against another case, immunity can vary depending on how seriously ill someone was and how long ago they were infected.

TRUMP SURGEON GENERAL SPEAKS OUT ON VACCINATING KIDS

Researchers have found that vaccination after COVID-19 infection can boost protection for adults.

""COVID-19 vaccines have undergone – and will continue to undergo – the most intensive safety monitoring in U.S. history. Vaccinating children will help protect them from getting COVID-19 and therefore reducing their risk of severe disease, hospitalizations, or developing long-term COVID-19 complications. Getting your children vaccinated can help protect them against COVID-19, as well as reduce disruptions to in-person learning and activities by helping curb community transmission,"" the CDC said in a Tuesday news release.

""We know from our experience with the Delta variant that this virus is unpredictable, and we cannot afford to be complacent. It is critical to use science and data to guide our decisions about the pandemic and school COVID-19 plans,"" American Academy of Pediatrics President Lee Savio Beers said in a Tuesday statement. ""We have also entered flu season, and now have an opportunity for children to receive vaccinations for both the flu and COVID-19, which can be done during a single visit.""

The CDC says COVID-19 shots can be administered at the same visits as vaccines for the flu.

Both flu shots and COVID-19 shots are available at pharmacies across the country and COVID-19 vaccines are being offered at pediatricians’ offices, health clinics, hospitals and schools.

Walgreens planned to commence kids' vaccinations on Saturday and said parents could sign up online or by calling 1-800-Walgreens and CVS was also accepting appointments for vaccinations at select pharmacies starting on Sunday.

Children should get the dose that is right for their age on the day of vaccination and pediatricians say not to postpone vaccination due to age.

Pfizer and Moderna are now testing low doses of their vaccines in children younger than 5 years old.

President Biden said Tuesday that the CDC's decision to sign off on the Pfizer vaccine was a ""major step forward for our nation in our fight to defeat the virus.""

""It will parents to end months of anxious worrying about their kids, and reduce the extent to which children spread the virus to others,"" he said.

The WHO tweeted that its technical advisory group had ruled that benefits of the shot, known as Covaxin, significantly outweighed the risks and that it met WHO standards for protection against Covid-19

The decision had been delayed as the advisory group sought additional clarifications from Bharat Biotech before conducting a final risk-benefit assessment for the vaccine's global use.

WHO's Strategic Advisory Group of Experts on Immunization also recommended Covaxin's use in two doses, with an interval of four weeks, in age groups 18 and above. These recommendations are in line with the company's guidance.

Covaxin was given emergency-use authorization in India in January even before the completion of its late-stage trial, which later found the shot to be 78% effective against severe Covid-19.

WHO's decision is expected to help millions of Indians who have received Covaxin to travel outside the country.

Stuck in a village in southern India for nine months and unable to return to his job in Saudi Arabia, Sugathan P.R. said he was very happy to hear the news.

""I am greatly relieved with the development since the WHO approval precludes the need for taking a local vaccine in Saudi Arabia,"" Sugathan told Reuters, adding he planned to leave for Dubai on Sunday on the way to Saudi. read more

The emergency use listing would allow Bharat Biotech to ship Covaxin to countries that rely on WHO guidance for their regulatory decisions.

Sharing with the world

WHO's approval may also clear the way for India to commit supplies to the COVAX global vaccine sharing effort, which is co-led by the WHO and aims to provide equitable access to shots for low- and middle-income countries.

The listing procedure is a prerequisite for COVAX vaccine supply and allows countries to speed up their own regulatory approval to import and administer COVID-19 shots, the WHO said in its statement.

Before curbing overseas vaccine shipments in April, India had donated or sold more than 66 million Covid-19 doses, including Covaxin.

Bharat Biotech said in a statement that it has established Covaxin manufacturing to reach an annualized capacity of 1 billion doses by the end of 2021, with technology transfer activities in progress with companies in India and elsewhere.

""It is important for Bharat Biotech to improve its production capacity to meet the improved demand for other countries following this approval,"" said Prashant Khadayate, a pharma analyst at GlobalData.

According to GlobalData's Pharma Intelligence Center, Covaxin is the second-most popular vaccine after Covishield as part of the COVID-19 vaccination drive in India.

""The WHO emergency approval will further improve the credibility of Covaxin and will boost our indigenous research capabilities at a global level. Moreover, we can see improved penetration of Covaxin usage in other countries,"" analyst Khadayate added.

The Hyderabad-based firm, which developed Covaxin with an Indian state research body, started sharing data with the WHO in early July.

Bharat Biotech's vaccine is the seventh to win WHO backing following two mRNA shots from Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna, adenovirus vector vaccines developed by AstraZeneca and its Covishield version made by the Serum Institute of India and Johnson & Johnson, and China's inactivated vaccines from Sinovac Biotech and Sinopharm.

Bharat Biotech has faced controversy over the vaccine in the past. Earlier this year, more than a dozen Phase 3 trial participants in slum areas of the Indian city of Bhopal told CNN they didn't realize they were part of a clinical trial -- instead, they thought they were being vaccinated.

Bharat Biotech, ICMR, and People's Hospital in Bhopal, which ran the trial, have denied wrongdoing."

Both studies show the vaccines strongly protect against severe disease and death, even months after people were first vaccinated and as the more transmissible Delta variant renewed the spread of the virus.

One large, ongoing study of 780,000 veterans shows all three vaccines being used in the US provide strong protection against death from Covid-19, even as their efficacy against mild and asymptomatic infection fell off dramatically.

Researchers looking at men and women getting treatment at Veterans Health Administration facilities found that overall vaccine efficacy against all types of infection fell from 87.9% in February to 48.1% in October. They only counted fully vaccinated veterans, and only counted test results from polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests, the gold standard for determining infection.

""Although breakthrough infection increased risk of death, vaccination remained protective against death in persons who became infected during the Delta surge,"" the researchers wrote in their report, published in the journal Science.

""Our analysis by vaccine type, including the Pfizer-BioNTech, Moderna, and (Johnson & Johnson's) Janssen vaccines, suggests declining vaccine effectiveness against infection over time, particularly for the Janssen vaccine. Yet, despite increasing risk of infection due to the Delta variant, vaccine effectiveness against death remained high, and compared to unvaccinated Veterans, those fully vaccinated had a much lower risk of death after infection. These results demonstrate an urgent need to reinstate multiple layers of protection, such as masking and physical distancing -- even among vaccinated persons -- while also bolstering current efforts to increase vaccination.""

The researchers say their data is more up to date than data provided by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, although it looks only at veterans, who may not be representative of the US population. The group studied represents 2.7% of the US population and while it skews more heavily in favor of males, it may represent more minorities than other study groups, Barbara Cohn, an epidemiologist at the Oakland, California Public Health Institute who helped conduct the study, told CNN.

In March, Johnson & Johnson's vaccine was 86.4% effective in preventing any type of infection. By September, this had fallen to 13%, they reported.

In March, Moderna's vaccine was 89.2% effective in preventing any infection. This fell to 58% by September.

Pfizer's vaccine was 86.9% effective against any infection in March and effectiveness fell to 43.3% by September, they reported.

From July to October 2021, they found, vaccine effectiveness against death among veterans under 65 was 73% for J&J's Janssen vaccine, 81.5% for Moderna's, and 84.3% for Pfizer's and for those 65 and older it was 52.2% for Janssen's, 75.5% for Moderna's, and 70.1% for Pfizer's.

""Everybody does better if they are vaccinated, Janssen people included,"" Cohn said. ""Vaccination is keeping people out of the hospital, even during Delta.""

A second study was coordinated with the CDC and found that people vaccinated with either Pfizer's or Moderna's vaccines are much less likely to end up in the hospital on a ventilator or to die from infection than unvaccinated people.

Unvaccinated patients accounted for 91% of Covid-19 deaths and nearly 94% of those with a combined need for ventilators or death, the team reported in the Journal of the American Medical Association.

""We are very confident now that the vaccine is still helping you, even if you get Covid,"" Dr. Wesley Self, an associate professor at Vanderbilt University who led the study team, told CNN. ""Even those who get sick don't get as sick as they would if they were unvaccinated.""

The team at 21 US hospitals in 18 states studied 4,513 patients admitted to hospitals with respiratory diseases between March and July. ""Unvaccinated patients accounted for 84.2% of COVID-19 hospitalizations. Hospitalization for COVID-19 was significantly associated with decreased likelihood of vaccination,"" the team wrote.

Not enough people had been vaccinated with Johnson & Johnson's Janssen vaccine to provide sufficient data for the study, Self said. He noted that other studies have shown the Janssen vaccine is less effective than the mRNA vaccines made by Pfizer and Moderna.

""We have known for several months that the mRNA vaccines prevent people from being infected with Covid and prevent people from being hospitalized with Covid. What was not clear from data before was if people still get Covid despite being vaccinated. Was the vaccine beneficial? The answer is a resounding yes,"" Self said.

""They are far less likely to become critically ill and die. That tells us the vaccines are attenuating the severity of disease."""

The US Food and Drug Administration issued emergency use authorization on Friday, October 29, for Pfizer's Covid-19 vaccine for children aged 5 to 11.

Pfizer says a clinical trial showed its vaccine provides more than 90% protection against symptomatic disease among children, even at one-third the dose, and the company hopes the lower dose will reduce the risk of any side effects.

Within days of the authorization, families were jumping at the chance to vaccinate their children.

China tamed the initial outbreak in Wuhan by locking down the city of more than 10 million people, confining residents to their homes for weeks and suspending public transportation.

Since then, Beijing has adopted a zero-tolerance playbook to quell resurgences of the virus. Harnessing the reach and force of the authoritarian state and its surveillance power, it has imposed snap lockdowns, tracked close contacts, placed thousands into quarantine and tested millions.

Before anywhere else in the world, China's economy roared back to growth and life returned to something approaching normal — all within a bubble created to shield its 1.4 billion people from a raging pandemic that has wreaked havoc and claimed millions of lives across the globe.

The ruling Communist Party has seized on that success, touting it as evidence of the supposed superiority of its one-party system over Western democracies, especially the United States.

But as the pandemic drags on, local outbreaks have continued to flare up, frustrating the government's mission to eliminate the virus within China's borders.

And now, as much of the world starts to reopen and learn to live with Covid, China is looking increasingly isolated by comparison — and determinedly inward-facing.

JUST WATCHED How China's zero-case obsession turns country into a 'Covid purgatory' Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH How China's zero-case obsession turns country into a 'Covid purgatory' 03:00

This apparent inward turn is evident in the itinerary of the country's supreme leader Xi Jinping, who hasn't left China for almost 22 months and counting.

It is manifest in the drastic reduction in people-to-people exchanges between China and the rest of the world, as the flow of tourist, academic and business trips slows to a trickle.

But it is also reflected in parts of the country's national psyche — a broader shift that has been years in the making since Xi took the helm of the Communist Party nearly a decade ago, yet accentuated and exacerbated by the pandemic and the politics around it.

While taking increasing pride in China's traditional culture and growing national strength, many Chinese people are turning progressively suspicious, critical or even outright hostile toward the West — along with any ideas, values or other forms of influence associated with it.

In a sense, the closed borders have almost become a physical extension of that insular-leaning mentality taking hold in parts of China , from top leaders to swathes of the general public.

For now, Beijing's zero-Covid policy still enjoys overwhelming public support, even as China shows no sign of reopening in the foreseeable future. But analysts question how sustainable it is for the country to remain shut off from the world — and whether there could be considerations other than public health at play.

Sealed behind China's borders

For nearly two years, most people in China have been unable to travel overseas, due to the country's stringent border restrictions: international flights are limited, quarantine upon reentry is harsh and lengthy, and Chinese authorities have ceased issuing or renewing passports for all but essential travel.

Foreign visitors, from tourists to students, are largely banned from China. Those few who are allowed to enter, as well as returning Chinese citizens, must undergo at least 14 days of strict centralized quarantine. And that can be extended to up to 28 days by local authorities, often followed by another lengthy period of home observation.

The Chinese government has ordered local authorities to build permanent quarantine facilities for overseas arrivals, following the example of the southern metropolis of Guangzhou, which erected a 5,000-room quarantine center spanning an area the size of 46 football fields.

With the borders virtually sealed, even China's top leaders are bunkering down in the country. Neither Xi nor Premier Li Keqiang, or the other five members on the party's top decision-making Politburo Standing Committee, are known to have made foreign visits during the pandemic.

Xi's last trip abroad was in January 2020, when he made a two-day visit to Myanmar to promote his signature Belt and Road Initiative — an ambitious program to boost infrastructure and trade across Asia, Europe and Africa, which has lost much of its steam since Covid-19 emerged.

The border closure has also come as China is turning inward on itself ideologically under Xi, said Carl Minzner, a senior fellow for China studies at the Council on Foreign Relations.

""Ideologically, China is slowly becoming more insular compared to the reform and opening up era of the '80s and '90s — this is a hallmark of Xi's new era,"" he said.

Chinese President Xi Jinping speaks at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing on October 9, 2021.

Over the past years, a revival of traditional culture has taken hold across Chinese society , particularly among the younger generation who are proud of their cultural roots.

The trend is encouraged and heavily promoted by the party, in what Minzner calls ""a strategic effort to deploy Chinese tradition as an ideological shield against foreign values, particularly Western ones.""

Since taking office in late 2012, Xi has repeatedly warned against the ""infiltration"" of Western values such as democracy, press freedom and judicial independence. He has clamped down on foreign NGOs, churches, as well as Western textbooks — all seen as vehicles for undue foreign influence.

That has fueled a growing strand of narrow-minded nationalism, which casts suspicion on any foreign ties and views feminism, the LGBTQ movement, and even environmentalism as stooges of Western influence designed to undermine China.

Since the pandemic, that intolerance has only grown.

In June, nearly 200 Chinese intellectuals who participated in a Japanese government-sponsored exchange program were attacked on Chinese social media and branded ""traitors"" — for trips they took years ago.

In July, journalists from several foreign media outlets covering deadly floods in northern China were harassed online and at the scene by local residents , with staff from the BBC and Los Angeles Times receiving death threats, according to the Foreign Correspondents' Club of China.

And in August, a Chinese infectious disease expert was called a ""traitor"" who ""blindly worshiped Western ideas"" for suggesting China should eventually learn to coexist with Covid. Some even accused him of colluding with foreign forces to sabotage China's pandemic response.

While it is unclear to what extent these nationalist sentiments represent mainstream opinion, they've been given overriding prominence in China's government-managed public discourse, where most liberal-leaning voices have been silenced.

Victor Shih, a China expert at the University of California, San Diego, said while Xi's predecessors had ""grudgingly tolerated"" Western reporters, NGO workers and sometimes even welcomed academics to China, the current administration now views their presence as sources of undesirable influences.

And Covid measures have become a convenient way to keep them out. Since the pandemic, most academics and non-profit workers have stopped going to China due to the border restrictions and quarantine requirements, Shih said.

""This heavy filter that is applied today — and had been applied prior to the pandemic — will help filter out what (Chinese leaders) see as undesirable elements from coming into China and polluting the values of the Chinese people,"" Shih said.

Passengers wait for a flight at Daxing Airport in Beijing on February 8, 2021.

But even after the border reopens, it remains to be seen how the Chinese government will allow foreign visitors to return — and whether some sort of additional screening might stay in place.

""The question is how quickly it'll want to relax restrictions on the flows of people into and out of China. Currently, that's primarily a health-related issue. But I do think the longer it takes, it also begins to get fused into political issues,"" said Minzer, from the Council on Foreign Relations.

""It totally seems possible to me that the relaxations happen for different groups at different times,"" he said, adding that foreign researchers who focus on topics the Chinese government deems politically sensitive could be among the last to be allowed in.

But Shih noted that attempts to eliminate ""foreign influence"" were unlikely to work, when China eventually resumes contact with the world.

Despite Beijing's deteriorating relations with the United States, Britain, Australia and other Western countries, large numbers of Chinese students are still likely to pursue their studies there.

When the US Embassy and consulates in China resumed issuing student visas to Chinese nationals in May, they were flooded with applications. In August, before the start of the new academic year, the Shanghai Pudong International Airport saw long lines of students and parents with big suitcases stretching hundreds of meters at check-in.

""China cannot do without its best and brightest. They will go back to China — having lived in the West, some of them will love China even more, others will gain this skepticism about the Chinese political system,"" he said.

Public support for zero Covid

For now, Chinese authorities are doubling down on their resolve to eliminate the virus, resorting to increasingly extreme measures to curb local flare-ups.

Public health experts have attributed China's reluctance to relax its zero-Covid policy partly to uncertainty about the efficacy of Chinese vaccines, especially in face of the highly infectious Delta variant.

JUST WATCHED Video of child taken to quarantine alone gains attention in China Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Video of child taken to quarantine alone gains attention in China 02:20

But political considerations have also played a role. Since containing the initial outbreak in Wuhan, the Chinese government has held up its effective containment efforts as proof of the supposed superiority of the country's authoritarian political system. The success of zero-Covid is thus hailed as an ideological and moral victory over the faltering response of the US and other Western democracies.

And there is plenty of public support for the hardline approach, too. In China, public tolerance toward infections is extremely low, and fear of the virus still runs high -- partly caused by scarring memories of the devastation in Wuhan, but also fed by unrelenting state media coverage on the horror of rampaging infections abroad.

Beijing has repeatedly blamed local flare-ups on the import of coronavirus from overseas, either through air passengers, frozen food or other goods. On social media, calls have been growing for authorities to extend the already lengthy quarantine for overseas arrivals, as many blamed Chinese travelers returning from abroad for bringing the virus to China.

""In mainstream opinion, Covid-19 is still regarded as an extremely deadly disease -- even if you don't die from it you'll suffer from some kinds of serious health problems for the rest of your life -- people are genuinely afraid,"" said Lucas Li, a software engineer from southern Guangdong province.

A medical worker collects a throat swab sample from a citizen for nucleic acid testing during a citywide Covid-19 testing campaign on August 3, 2021, in Wuhan, Hubei province of China.

Li, who works in California, has had a tough time traveling between China and the US over the past two years. After returning home for Lunar New Year in 2020, he was trapped for eight months in China due to the US travel ban. Then in May, he had to rush home again for family reasons, but flights to China were hard to come by. He ended up paying $4,800 for a one-way ticket -- about seven times the price of a round trip in usual times -- and underwent two weeks of hotel quarantine.

Li said while he doesn't necessarily agree with zero-Covid, he understands why the government is sticking to it. The border closure has had limited impact on the Chinese economy, and the lack of international travel or exchanges is hardly a concern for most people, he said.

While overseas vacations had become a common part of life for China's growing middle class, the country's vast size and rich diversity provides plenty of options for domestic tourism as an alternative. And for people like Li, essential travel outside of China is still possible, albeit troublesome.

""I'm very sure the mainstream public opinion will choose to continue with the border closure -- this is without a doubt,"" Li said.

But experts say that could come at a political cost for China, which has seen its international image plummet since the start of the pandemic. Unfavorable views of China have reached record highs among much of the developed world, according to surveys conducted by the Pew Research Service.

""Other political parties, or even maybe Xi's predecessors, might have seen this dramatic reduction in contact between China and the rest of the world as a big problem. But for now, the Xi administration does not seem to recognize this as a problem,"" University of California's Shih said.

The life and legacy of Colin Powell, the first Black US secretary of state, was honored during his funeral service on Friday, November 5.

Former presidents, dignitaries and friends gathered for the service at Washington National Cathedral, which was closed to the public.

Powell died on October 18 due to complications from Covid-19 at the age of 84. Though he was fully vaccinated against Covid-19, Powell, who had multiple myeloma and Parkinson's, was immunocompromised, putting him at greater risk to the virus.

Coronavirus safety measures will be followed to protect the health of the attendees, according to the cathedral, which has hosted the funerals of top Washington officials and public servants."

London (CNN Business) News that prices for American consumers are rising at the fastest rate in three decades has spooked investors and economists, piling pressure on President Joe Biden and the Federal Reserve to respond more aggressively.

What's happening: Biden and his team are now steeling themselves for high inflation to persist into 2022, a problem for Democrats ahead of next November's midterm elections. Senior Fed official Richard Clarida has indicated that if inflation stays elevated, the central bank could opt to hike interest rates next year.

Inflation is currently ""much more than a moderate overshoot"" of the Fed's 2% target, he said earlier this week. ""I would certainly not consider a repeat performance a policy success,"" he continued.

Larry Summers, an economist who served in both the Obama and Clinton administrations, has been sounding the alarm on inflation for months.

""I think that the policymakers in Washington, unfortunately, have almost every month been behind the curve,"" Summers told CNN on Wednesday.

But not everyone thinks the Fed and the Biden administration need to change course dramatically. In fact, former Fed economist Claudia Sahm, a Summers critic, believes that America's economy still needs trillions of dollars in additional stimulus.

I asked her a few questions about this week's inflation data and the subsequent debate. Our Q&A has been condensed and lightly edited for clarity.

What's the big picture takeaway from the latest inflation data, in your view?

Big price increases in October, on top of higher-than-normal inflation since the summer, are unambiguously bad for consumers. But Covid, not inflation, is the problem. The rise and fall of cases throughout the pandemic has created immense disruptions in our economic and everyday lives.

What does a 6.2% annual increase in the Consumer Price Index say about the narrative that inflation is transitory?

The view that inflation would step back down this year was always based on the view that the pandemic would recede. Covid is still here, and as recently as a few months ago, it surged due to the Delta variant. Global supply chains are a mess, largely due to an insufficient global health response. There are no signs that the price increases due to Covid-related factors are spreading into other prices. Transitory means short-lived. As with the pandemic itself, we have been promised that it would get better soon, and it takes longer.

A number of other economists are pointing to rising rents as one example that price increases are broadening. Do you disagree with this assessment?

I disagree. House prices increased more slowly than usual during the pandemic due to eviction moratoriums, mortgage forbearance, and people waiting to move. The faster house price inflation now is basically a ""getting back to normal."" That normal is not good, but it is what we had before Covid.

Should the Fed stay the course? Or might it need to move faster?

The Fed decided to reduce the pace of asset purchases by $15 billion in November and December and then reevaluate at their next meeting. The world is changing quickly, and it is appropriate for them to get more data before deciding on the pace after that.

What should the response be in Congress and/or from the Biden administration? What are the implications for Biden's $1.9 trillion Build Back Better social spending package?

Congress needs to pass the Build Back Better legislation immediately. It is an investment in our children, low-wage workers, education, health care and fighting climate change. A half a year of higher-than-normal inflation is not a reason to squander this opportunity to act.

Two more big companies want to split themselves up

This week could mark the end of an era for more than one iconic conglomerate.

The latest: Japan's Toshiba outlined plans on Friday to break up into three independent companies, a pitch that involves spinning off its energy and infrastructure business as well as its device and storage business.

The proposal follows a campaign by activist shareholders and a strategic review in the wake of a corporate governance scandal.

Toshiba TOSBF said Friday that it saw splitting the company as the best path forward.

""The decision allows each business to significantly increase its focus and facilitate more agile decision-making and leaner cost structures,"" it said in a statement.

The move by the 146-year-old conglomerate comes just days after General Electric said it would split into three separate public companies, spinning out its aviation, healthcare and energy businesses.

Step back: What's driving these storied conglomerates to try to dissemble themselves? One factor is the market, which currently favors streamlined operations over sprawling empires.

Another is the role of more aggressive activist shareholders, who build up stakes and then lobby for companies to make large structural changes.

Johnson & Johnson JNJ There's more: announced Friday that it's planning to split into two public companies, spinning off its division that sells Band-Aids and Tylenol. Shares are up 4% in premarket trading.

Shell RDSA I'm also keeping an eye on, which is being lobbied by the hedge fund Third Point to separate its legacy fossil fuel business from its push into renewables . The company has rejected this proposal. But could other shareholders take Third Point's side?

North American companies are racing to order robots

The companies rushing to meet surging demand for goods while struggling to fill open positions are in a bind. Increasingly, they're turning to a new solution.

According to the Association for Advancing Automation, or A3, strong sales of robots over the summer brought the total number of orders in North America to 29,000 units so far this year. That's the highest level on record.

Breaking it down: The number of units sold is up 37% from the same period in 2020 and trumps the previous high set in 2017 by nearly 6%.

""With labor shortages throughout manufacturing, logistics and virtually every industry, companies of all sizes are increasingly turning to robotics and automation to stay productive and competitive,"" A3 President Jeff Burnstein said in a statement.

The group said it wasn't just carmakers placing orders. Nearly two-thirds of sales came from non-automotive industries, including metals and food and consumer goods.

Big picture: A3 advocates for the benefits of automation, arguing it makes workplaces safer and frees up people for more rewarding roles. Even if that's true in the long run, it could seriously shake up the job market in the immediate term — another way in which the post-pandemic economy could look very different

(CNN) A great win for the Grand Old Party could be a bad omen for Democrats. Republican Glenn Youngkin picked up momentum at just the right moment to defeat Democrat Terry McAuliffe in the Virginia governor's race. This election could well foreshadow disaster for Democrats in next year's midterm elections .

Here's what Youngkin got right and McAuliffe got wrong:

Being a political newcomer, running against a candidate with 95% name ID, Youngkin began the general election with his work cut out for him. The campaign invested heavily in introducing the affable businessman to the people of Virginia. People need to know that you care before they care what you know. Even during the virtual era of Covid campaigning, he showed genuine concern for the people of Virginia.

Youngkin wisely took the Goldilocks approach when it comes to Trump; not to close, not too far, just the right distance. Youngkin didn't disavow the former president, but he didn't lock arms either. This allowed the campaign to tailor its message to Trump's base as well as independent voters in the suburbs.

As many Republican candidates have learned, if you poke the Trump bear, he punches back.

The results prompted the employee to ask in a post on the company's internal site: ""Do our policies combatting the spread of misinformation on Facebook apply to climate denialism?""

More than a year later, in January 2021, a Facebook employee noted a similar concern when searching for ""climate change"" on the social network's video-on-demand service, Facebook Watch. The second result, according to the employee, was a video titled ""Climate Change Panic is not based on facts."" The video had been posted nine days earlier and already had 6.6 million views, according to another internal post.

These examples were flagged byemployees on the company's internal site, according to documents reviewed by CNN Business. These were part of the hundreds of internal company documents included as evidence to support disclosures made to the Securities and Exchange Commission and provided to Congress in redacted form by Facebook whistleblower Frances Haugen's legal counsel. A consortium of news organizations, including CNN, reviewed the redacted versions received by Congress.

The documents highlight how, for years, some employees of the social media company — which recently changed its name to Meta — have raised alarms about climate change misinformation spreading on its platforms, and called on the company to do more to crack down on it.

There has long been public pressure on the social media company to take action on climate change misinformation. In March, CEO Mark Zuckerberg admitted to lawmakers that ""climate misinformation ... is a big issue.""

This week, Meta announced additional climate-related efforts that coincided with the start of the COP26 Climate Summit, where world leaders gathered to discuss efforts to prevent catastrophic disruptions due to climate change. Meta was already facing heavy scrutiny following the leak of tens of thousands of pages of internal documents Haugen took from the company, now known as the ""Facebook Papers.""

Although Facebook has taken a number of steps in recent years to address climate change misinformation, it has so far resisted calls to remove such content altogether, the way it does for Covid-19 or election misinformation. Instead, it has focused on efforts to promote good information and relies on third-party fact checkers to label false claims.

On Monday, the company's VP of Global Affairs, Nick Clegg, announced in a blog post additional steps Facebook is taking to address climate change, including expanding informational labels on some posts about climate change to more than a dozen countries.

But the company's own research has hinted at limitations with some of its strategy, including highlighting user trust and awareness issues with its Climate Science Center , a dedicated hub for climate change information that launched last year, the documents show. Some employees have also expressed concern that Facebook's current efforts aren't sufficient, documents show. In a comment on another internal post from earlier this year about the company's efforts to combat climate change — including by enabling people to raise funds to fight climate change on Instagram and Facebook — one employee said: ""This is great work. Can we take it a step farther and start classifying and removing climate misinformation and hoaxes from our platforms?""

Meta has repeatedly said the ""Facebook Papers"" paint a skewed picture of the company and its efforts. The company said the internal documents underscore ""the reasons why we've launched our Climate Science Center and has informed our approach to connecting people with authoritative information about climate change from the world's leading climate change organizations.""

""As a result, more than 100,000 people are visiting the Climate Science Center every day and we're continuing to update it with new features and more actionable resources so people know how they can make a difference,"" Meta spokesperson Kevin McAlister said in a statement to CNN Business. He added that on Facebook Search and Watch, the company has removed climate denial suggestions and now directs users to the Climate Science Center and other authoritative information sources, and that misinformation makes up only a small percentage of all climate-related content on the company's platforms.

Experts, however, say the stakes could not be higher for Facebook to further ramp up its solutions for this problem — and soon.

""Given that [climate change] is an existential threat, we can't be casual about the seriousness about the threat of climate misinformation,"" said John Cook, a post-doctoral research fellow at the Climate Change Communication Research Hub at Monash University. ""It needs to be addressed with the same level of urgency and proactiveness that they're showing with Covid-19 and election misinformation.""

Facebook launched its Climate Science Center in September 2020 in an effort to provide users with authoritative information about climate change.

The shortcomings of Facebook's climate misinformation strategy

Facebook launched its Climate Science Center last fall in an effort to provide users with authoritative, reliable information about climate change and climate science. In September, it said the resource had expanded to 16 countries and was reaching more than 100,000 daily visitors. (Facebook had 1.93 billion daily active users as of that same month.) On Monday, the company said the Climate Science Center will soon be available in more than 100 countries.

But the company's internal documents suggest there may be barriers to effectively countering misinformation with the Climate Science Center.

""Facebook is a key place for people to get information related to climate change, so there is an opportunity to build knowledge through our platform,"" according to one internal report posted in April. However, the researchers found user awareness of the Climate Science Center was low. The report said 66% of users surveyed who had visited the center ""say they are not aware"" of it; 86% of those who hadn't visited it said they didn't know about it.

The report also found that some users did not trust the information Facebook published in its Climate Science Center, especially US users. This tracks with research on the effects of climate misinformation, according to Cook.

""Providing facts is necessary but it's insufficient to deal with misinformation,"" Cook said, adding that his and others' research has found that ""misinformation can cancel out facts."" For example, if a Facebook post says one thing and a fact-check label says another, it can leave a user confused and believing neither. An effective strategy to address climate misinformation ""needs to be a mix of providing facts and countering misinformation with fact checking, but also there need to be efforts to reduce the spread of misinformation or to bring down misinformation,"" Cook said.

Meta, however, says that research was meant to inform internal discussions but was not representative of its user base and therefore not to measure casual relationships between its users and real-world issues. It also notes that some outside research has found that, in general, people in the United States are less likely to believe in climate change than people from other countries. A Pew Research survey from last year, for example, found that the United States ranked among the bottom in a list of 14 developed countries in terms of its citizens believing global climate change is ""a major threat"" to their country.

Facebook says it does ""downrank,"" or reduce the spread, of climate change content that third-party fact checkers have labeled as false, and says ""we take action"" against pages, groups or accounts that regularly share false claims about climate science.

""We work with a global network of over 80 independent fact-checking organizations who review and rate content, including climate content, in more than 60 languages,"" the company said in blog post Monday. ""When they rate content as false, we add a warning label and move it lower in News Feed so fewer people see it. We don't allow ads that have been rated by one of our fact-checking partners.""

But it doesn't outright remove climate change misinformation — something it does do for misinformation about Covid-19, vaccines and elections.

Zuckerberg explained that policy to lawmakers in a March hearing. ""We divide the misinformation into things that could cause imminent physical harm, of which Covid misinformation that might lead someone to get sick ... falls in the category of imminent physical harm, and we take down that content. And then other misinformation are things that are false but may not lead to imminent physical harm, we label and reduce their distribution but leave them up,"" he said.

However, environmental advocates say climate change does indeed present imminent threats to safety.

""People around the US have faced harm from extreme events just in the last few months with Hurricane Ida and people dying, wildfires across the West and extreme heat in the Northwest,"" said Kathy Mulvey, accountability campaign director for the Climate & Energy team at the Union of Concerned Scientists. ""Climate change is not a threat in the future, it's a reality in the present."""

(CNN) It's only November, but already, Americans are panicking about holiday shopping . Retailers were advertising Black Friday deals in October. Goods are more expensive, shipping is taking significantly longer, and many items are already back-ordered. Gift givers are hearing a clear message: Buy now or you may not have what you want under the tree on Christmas morning.

What if we didn't?

What if, instead of starting our annual shopping frenzy, we took the lessons we've learned from this pandemic era about the importance of people and experience over acquiring things and applied them to the holiday season? What if we made the December holidays about our connections with each other, and not about presents and consumerism?

It's been a catastrophic year and a half for so many American workers, and a year of other sweeping transitions for many more. While the country has made a significant recovery since this time last year, thanks in large part to a successful vaccine campaign and President Joe Biden's Covid relief package, millions of American are still out of work, and many say they are still behind on rent , and that their kids are going hungry.

A huge number of mothers have been pushed out of the labor force, thanks to the US's refusal to provide any form of universal childcare and our government's unconscionable refusal to provide paid family leave. More than a million women who left paid work during the pandemic have not returned, many of them single moms who are their family's sole breadwinner.

And the pandemic seems to have fueled another curious jobs trend: Workers are quitting by the millions , perhaps because they have better options elsewhere, and some, perhaps, because the pandemic has radically recalibrated what they believe is important and how they want to spend their time.

We can take all of that with us into late November and December and its season of giving: Instead of stressing over Amazon orders and Black Friday deals and how we're going to afford the inflated cost of goods, we can choose to make the holidays a time for (vaccinated) gatherings, delicious shared food, and quality time with loved ones.

Gift giving doesn't totally have to go, but we could reorient our definition of a good Christmas away from one defined by more and more physical possessions toward one defined by care and affection.

Perhaps that includes a thoughtfully chosen token, but it doesn't have to mean a mountain of presents procured via fistfights at Best Buy, or days wasted on the phone with overworked customer service representatives trying to explain to angry buyers why the toy they ordered in November won't arrive until February.

American hyper-consumerism is also leaving our children a troubling legacy, as the production of all of these toys, clothing items and other mass-produced disposable things contributes to the climate change that is making our planet less livable by the day.

While we wring our hands over supply chain issues for Christmas gifts, we should be paying much more attention to how supply chains are a chief driver of greenhouse gas emissions -- a part of companies' carbon footprint that they generally don't count in their claims about sustainability, emissions reductions and carbon neutrality.

In short, perhaps there's no greater metaphor for where we're headed than a big pile of stuff bought on credit from planet-destroying retailers and placed under a dead tree, nearly all of which will be headed to a landfill in a few years' (or weeks') time.

We can choose to opt out of all of it.

Don't get me wrong, I love Christmas as much as the next religiously agnostic but fairly sentimental person. Farm-grown Christmas trees are far from the biggest drivers of climate change. And I certainly can't fault the many cash-strapped parents who have had to say ""no"" to purchases and gifts all year long who now want to make Christmas special: it is much easier to argue, as I am doing here, for a Christmas of connection instead of stuff when you live in relative abundance and have many other opportunities for saying yes to what your loved ones want.

It's more difficult when a gift-free Christmas would feel like a painful extension of material scarcity and unrequited desires.

Most of us occasionally have to buy from stores that don't align with our values in order to meet our needs and our budgets. But when it comes to totally optional holiday spending, we can choose not to send companies so much of our hard-earned cash if we find them objectionable.

More conscientious spending is one option -- shopping at smaller local retailers that desperately need our business, and selecting a small number of thoughtfully-chosen gifts. Another: choosing to spend nothing on items at all, and instead investing your money in gathering, entertaining, and feeding your loved ones.

Forgoing or significantly cutting down on store-bought gifts doesn't make you a Scrooge; if you instead use your time and money for more social and engaged activities, this reallocation of resources can make for a much happier holiday. There's a large body of research on what contributes to both short- and long-term joy, and the results are clear : Spending money on material goods brings far less happiness than spending money on experiences like concerts, dining out and sports games.

That's in large part because experiences happen with other people -- they foster connection , get a person excited in anticipation and make memories that sustain us.

Covid should have driven this home: When the pandemic cut off many avenues for normal interaction and stuck most of us at home surrounded by our things, were we happier isolated with our belongings? Or did we miss experiences (eating a meal with friends, traveling, going to the movies, even just working side by side with colleagues) and the stuff that money can't buy: The alchemy of a great dinner party, the thrill of charged eye contact with an attractive stranger, the warmth of a loved one's embrace, the moment a new grandparent meets their new grandbaby?

For more than a year, many of us have wanted for affection and connection; many have lost friends, neighbors and family members to a disease that has killed more than 5 million people worldwide. And as we head into our second Covid winter, a lot of us are exhausted, overwhelmed and broke. So why not get each other what we actually value instead of spending money we don't have on things we don't need?

When we think about the best and most meaningful moments of our lives, we know intuitively that our greatest happiness isn't made by stuff. You don't have to leave the space under the tree totally barren or the stockings hanging empty.

But instead of acting as though you can quantify joy by tallying up the number of boxes and bows from Santa, and instead of spending the next six weeks stressing about supply chains, mounting costs and late deliveries, we could all shift our attention to what actually fills us up and warms our hearts: The people we love, and the time we spend with them."

Photos with Santa, an annual holiday tradition for many families, were upended last year by the pandemic.

Some retail locations that typically host in-person Santa visits decided to forgo the event completely. Others made changes — like putting Santa behind plexiglass , or Zooming with Santa on a large digital screen — which likely resulted in awkward holiday family photos with Kris Kringle.

But that was 2020. Retailers and mall operators are eager to return holiday shoppers to a more familiar celebratory experience in the run-up to Christmas.

They're starting with in-person Santa visits.

Macy's

Perhaps no other Saint Nick is as iconic as Macy's Santa Claus, who's been making an in-person appearance since 1861 with the exception of last year.

Macy's M is bringing back Santa at Santaland events this year in Chicago, San Francisco and its flagship store at New York City's Herald Square. However, Macy's is keeping it a contactless and socially distanced visit this year. The retailer said it will follow each city's protocols for indoor masking.

Cherry Hill Programs, the leading provider of holiday Santa and photography events at malls nationwide, is setting up more than 672 Santa events this year in the US, Canada and Puerto Rico — including at malls run by Simon Properties, the largest mall operator in the United States.

Chris Landtroop, vice president of marketing for Cherry Hill Programs, said its Santas are vaccinated unless exempted for medical or religious reasons, in which case they will be tested weekly and it's staff at the events will also abide by local mask guidelines.

Brookfield

Brookfield Properties, a subsidiary of Brookfield Asset Management and the second-largest mall operator in the country, said Santa will be in 117 of its 130 malls. He's arriving in 23 of those malls on Friday.

More malls are bringing back in-person visits with Santa this year.

The Santa visits will revert back to the more traditional experience in which families have the option of having kids sit on Santa's lap for a chat and photos, said Katie Kurtz, senior vice president of business development with Brookfield Properties. ""Malls have a magical feeling this time of the year and we want to get back to that,"" she said.

Kurtz said families who want to remain socially distanced will have that option, too. The company is adhering to local mandates for masks for each mall location.

PREIT

Mall operator PREIT, which owns 19 malls primarily on the East Coast, including the Cherry Hill mall in New Jersey and the Willow Grove mall in Pennsylvania, placed Santa behind plexiglass last year at each mall.

This month, Santa makes a comeback atop a red fire truck at PREIT malls and he won't be behind a barrier for his meet-and-greet. PREIT said all of its Santas are vaccinated and kids will have the option to sit on his lap for photos.

PREIT is also following local mask mandates for in-mall visits.

Tanger

With close to 68% of the total US population having received at least one dose of the Covid-19 vaccine, according to the Centers for Disease Control & Prevention, some malls are holding more elaborate holiday events.

Tanger Factory Outlets last year held socially distanced Santa visits for its shoppers. It's bringing Santa back in person to more than 20 of its outlet centers this holiday season. In addition to photo ops, Santa will also be at tree lightings and at breakfasts with Santa events.

""We also have a fun The Elf on the Shelf scavenger hunt planned where we've placed the elves around our centers, some are inside of stores or at the food court,"" said Stephen Yalof, president and CEO of Tanger Outlets, which operates 36 upscale outlet shopping centers.

This year Tanger is hosting multiple Christmas tree lighting events instead of one big event at five of its locations. Yalof said it's a way to avoid one large congregation of people and also have shoppers coming back more than once to its malls.

Bringing people back to the mall

Bringing Santa back is a smart move, said Barbara Kahn, professor of marketing at the Wharton School.

""All these holiday events that retailers plan are really about boosting consumption ,"" said Kahn. ""Now post-Covid, malls and stores are trying to lure shoppers back and get them comfortable shopping in person again versus online.""

For retailers, in-store shopping presents certain advantages, she said. ""There's the serendipity of it. Shoppers tend to do more impulse buying in stores."" And with online shopping, product returns tend to be higher, which can be expensive for retailers, she added.

-- Correction: A previous version of this story incorrectly stated the number of malls PREIT controls in the United States. It has 13 US malls."

US Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi officiated the star-studded ceremony, at which actor Anya Taylor-Joy (the maid of honor), singer Olivia Rodrigo and California Governor Gavin Newsom were among the attendees.

""It's just like everything I could have dreamed of and more,"" Getty told Vogue. ""So it's wild when something so magical comes true because you've thought about it but didn't actually think it would.""

Getty's wedding style choices included references to her grandmother, who raised her and -- like Getty's father -- died in 2020. An embroidered couture veil and headdress, Christian Louboutin shoes and Getty's grandmother's jewelry were the finishing touches on the bridal look. The Persian rug-carpeted rotunda at the hall was another nod to her grandmother.

The couple's union was the culmination of an opulent, event-filled wedding weekend, which included a picnic lunch where Getty wore an archived Alexander McQueen gown.

Among the festivities was a British Invasion Mod Party held Thursday night at The Palace of Fine Arts in San Francisco (where party-goers were reportedly required to show Covid-19 vaccination cards). Event planner Stanlee Gatti transformed the space into a silvery nightclub with 1968 sci-fi film ""Barbarella"" in mind. Donning '60s hallmarks such as go-go boots, sequins and big hair, guests danced the night away to music DJed by Mark Ronson and performances by Earth, Wind & Fire.

Getty was the sartorial chameleon of the night: Styled by Carrie Goldberg of CLG Creative, the oil heiress wore a vintage Emanuel Ungaro dress with coral and diamond earrings from Stephen Russell, and a vintage Emilio Pucci dress and D'Accori shoes. The outfits were references to '60s style icons Mary Quant, Twiggy and Jean Shrimpton, Goldberg said to Vogue.

""We agreed that nothing should play it safe, and that we should focus on turning up the volume on the '60s vibe Ivy's so inspired by,"" Goldberg told the outlet."

Green Bay Packers travel to hostile Arrowhead Stadium without QB Aaron Rodgers

With Covid-19 positive (and unvaccinated ) quarterback Aaron Rodgers watching from home, the Green Bay Packers will visit the defending AFC champion Kansas City Chiefs on Sunday.

In Rodgers' place will be second-year quarterback Jordan Love, making his first ever NFL start. With 68 career passing yards and no touchdowns thrown, Love is some way behind three-time NFL MVP Rodgers' 53,071 yards and 429 touchdowns.

The Green Bay Packers sport an NFL-leading 7-1 record, but the 4-4 Kansas City Chiefs have begun to find their form and will be desperate for a win to climb back into the AFC West race.

Love warms up before the Packers' game against the Arizona Cardinals last month.

Titans begin life without Derrick Henry against the 7-1 Rams

The 7-1 Los Angeles Rams will host the 6-2 Tennessee Titans at LA's SoFi Stadium in the week's marquee matchup.

The Tennessee Titans will be without star running back Derrick Henry, who went on injured reserve after a foot surgery earlier this week.

Henry, who has more rushing touchdowns by himself (10) than 24 NFL teams, will be a major loss for the Titans as they attempt to maintain their lead in the AFC South and hope that Henry can return later in the season.

The Rams will be looking to extend their winning streak to five games and keep pace with the NFC West-leading Arizona Cardinals.

Derrick Henry is out indefinitely through injury.

AFC North grudge match with a key absence

Cross-state rivals Cincinnati Bengals and Cleveland Browns will square off in The Queen City.

This rivalry never lacks intensity, but this year the AFC North is one of the most tightly bunched divisions in the NFL with all four teams still firmly in contention.

The Cleveland Browns announced on Friday that the team had released star wide receiver Odell Beckham Jr., who had been disgruntled of late over his role with the team. Beckham caught seven touchdowns in 29 games during his tenure with the Browns.

""After careful consideration, internal discussions and conversations with Odell and his representation, we've determined that it is in the best interest of all parties involved that Odell no longer play for the Cleveland Browns,"" Browns General Manager Andrew Berry said in a statement.

""We appreciate all his efforts and contributions while in Cleveland, but we've just reached a point where it is best that we move forward as a team without Odell. We are finalizing the process of granting Odell his release and we wish him well as he continues his career.""

Odell Beckham Jr. was released by the Browns this week.

Draft position on the line for two of the league's worst teams

For a pair of teams well out of playoff contention, there is still something to play for (and maybe to lose for).

When the 1-7 Houston Texans head to South Florida to face the 1-7 Miami Dolphins, the loser will emerge with the second-worst record in the NFL.

That will put the loser hot on the heels of the 0-8 Detroit Lions for the top pick in next spring's NFL Draft. The Lions are mercifully on their bye in Week 9.

Five Super Bowl rematches

Among the remained week 9 NFL games, there are five repeats of previous Super Bowl match-ups.

Jets at Colts (played on Thursday night with the Colts winning 45-30) -- Super Bowl III won by the Jets

Broncos at Cowboys -- Super Bowl XII won by the Cowboys

His announcement comes one day after municipal elections that he and other Fulton County, Georgia, officials said ran relatively smoothly.

Barron's departure underscores the precarious position of election officials, who have faced unprecedented personal attacks in the last year and punishing new laws that threaten to sideline professional supervisors and install partisan actors in their stead.

Election observers have warned for months that the country could face a mass exodus of experienced election supervisors if the onslaught of threats continues, driven by relentless falsehoods that election fraud contributed to former President Donald Trump's loss a year ago.

""I think we have a lot of cowardly elected officials who won't let go of the 'Big Lie' because they are scared of their constituents,"" Barron told CNN in an interview. ""If they could have stood up, they could have put an end to this a long time ago.""

Republicans have identified opposing all coronavirus health protocols -- including mask requirements, school closures, vaccination mandates and more -- as a political winner.

View more opinion on CNN.

More than a month after a firestorm broke out between the United States and France over the Biden administration's colossally ill-considered torpedoing of a major French-Australian submarine deal , the vice president landed in Paris to try to patch things up. And so far, it's working.

Harris and French President Emmanuel Macron seemed delighted to see each other as they grasped arms in a Covid-conscious greeting outside the Élysée presidential palace Wednesday. ""I can tell you French people are extremely proud to have you here,"" Macron said at the start of their bilateral meeting. Their first tête-à-tête ran so long that aides tried to intervene and wrap up the meeting. Macron also gave Harris a tour of the building, pointing out the desk of France's first modern president Charles de Gaulle, who had his own prickly relationship with the United States.

The next morning, at a grand ceremony at the Arc de Triomphe, celebrating France's unknown soldier and Hubert Germain, France's last great World War II resistance fighter, who died last month at the age of 101, national television cameras focused on Harris, casting her image on a jumbotron screen overlooking the ceremony several times.

Later in the afternoon, the two sat side-by-side, carefully masked, in the front row of the Paris Peace Forum, chatting continuously, though out of earshot of any microphones. In her speech about inequality, she urged , ""Let us not be burdened by what has been, let us focus on what can be. And let us realize a better future together.""

Although she wasn't commenting directly on the relationship between the US and France, this has been the repeated refrain of her visit -- to look forward rather than back.

Macron later singled out Harris in his speech, saying, ""I am very happy, Madam Vice President, to have the United States back in the club of multilateralism. This is wonderful news ... Because I believe this is the rightful place for the United States of America.""

Still, whether all this bonhomie will be enough to patch over deeply frayed relations between the two countries dating back to Presidents Barack Obama and François Hollande, remains to be seen. What is apparent, however, is that the two leaders are touting their partnership on everything from defense to supply chain disruptions -- with the goal of making a mark at home as Macron faces the upcoming presidential election in April and Harris tries to burnish her foreign policy bona fides amid flagging approval ratings and infighting within the Democratic Party.

Clearly, both Macron and Harris hope they may be able to turn the page on past issues. ""Leadership is partnership,"" Macron said when he first met US President Joe Biden in England for the G7 summit in June. That was, of course, the very moment the United States was negotiating the submarine agreement with Australia and the UK, killing a 50-year pact with France, all without a single word of it to Macron or the French (Biden has since acknowledged the US was ""clumsy"" in its treatment of France).

Regardless of how Macron really feels, Harris' visit has also been a chance to distinguish himself from his far-right opponent in the elections next April. Macron is expected to run for reelection, although one of his senior advisers pointed out to me that the incumbent President has not yet formally announced his intention to seek a second term.

Either way, the far-right firebrand, Eric Zemmour, has already positioned himself as Macron's leading challenger, throwing down the gauntlet, particularly with respect to France's relations with the United States. In response to the last conciliatory meeting Macron had with Biden in Rome on the sidelines of the G20 summit, Zemmour said he had ""never seen such a humiliation."" One of Macron's counselors, who agreed to speak on the condition of anonymity to comment more frankly on the state of French politics, told me in an email that the President ""does not make decisions (on) the role of France in the world"" based on the views of Zemmour who, she added, ""is very far from the values the President believes in and fights for.""

A White House official said that the invitation for Harris to visit Paris came from Macron before the submarine imbroglio. Still, the timing was especially opportune for both leaders. With Harris seemingly fading from the domestic squabbles over Biden's agenda and Macron's hovering at around 24% going into the first round of elections (still the highest among any of his challengers), it's not hard to see a kindred view of this opportunity.

""If we want to be able to compete, we have to be good partners; we have to show up. America is a global leader,"" the White House briefer told reporters on Wednesday. And Macron's counselor echoed that sentiment, telling me, ""Our friendship (with the US) is robust, we are close allies, and finally we have many things to do together when it comes to global issues and regional crisis issues as partners.""

Still, it's been a difficult time all around for US-France relations, the foundations of which have been eroded over many years. It's quite clear that relationships that have been subject to the strain we've seen in recent years between the United States and France will take some time to heal. But consistency is essential.

On Friday, the Transportation Security Administration screened more air travelers in a single day than on any day since the start of the pandemic.

""JUST IN: @TSA officers screened 2,242,956 people at airport security checkpoints nationwide yesterday, Friday, Nov. 19. It's the highest checkpoint volume since passenger volume tanked in early 2020 as a result of the pandemic,"" TSA spokesperson Lisa Farbstein tweeted Saturday. ""The Thanksgiving travel period has begun! #MaskUp""

US travel organization AAA predicts Thanksgiving travel overall will rebound to near pre-pandemic levels, with 53.4 million Americans expected to travel for the holiday -- a 13% increase from last year.

That brings the total travel volume to just 5% below AAA's 2019 figure. And air travel is expected to be up 80% from last year, bringing it to just 9% below 2019. About 4.2 million travelers are expected to fly this year.

With recent operational meltdowns at Southwest and American Airlines top of mind, plus staffing issues and an uptick in international travel , many air travelers worry that things could get messy.

""Even before the pandemic, reports of major delays, cancellations and stranded passengers were somewhat of a holiday tradition,"" said Willis Orlando, senior product operations specialist at airfare deals site Scott's Cheap Flights

""This year, folks are understandably more nervous than ever,"" Orlando said, with the recent mass flight cancellations giving travelers pause. But he said airlines are making adjustments to head off potential issues, and he would be surprised to see the kind of ""major failures"" that have unfolded in recent months.

Related content Why flying is so bad and about to get worse

The usual delays related to bad weather are more likely, Orlando said.

Mike Boyd, president of aviation forecasting and consulting firm Boyd Group International, agrees.

""Unless we get the perfunctory snowstorm over Chicago O'Hare, over Atlanta over the holidays, I don't think we're going to have much of a problem at all,"" Boyd said. ""It's going to be busy, but it's not going to be necessarily total chaos like some folks are projecting.""

While early forecasts looked iffy, the National Weather Service now sees ""a relatively tranquil stretch of weather"" across most of the US mainland through Wednesday night. Wind could create some delays early in the week, forecasters say , and return trips over the weekend could see more weather disruptions.

While air travel is way up, the vast majority of travelers will still go by car, according to AAA, with 90% -- 48.3 million -- expected to drive.

And highway traffic and busy airports are just the beginning. There are also health issues to wrestle with and the safety of gatherings once you get there. With the holiday travel season upon us, here are expert tips for minimizing hassle and maximizing safety while traveling during a pandemic:

Preparing for holiday flights

TSA expects to screen more than 20 million people at airport security checkpoints nationwide over a 10-day period that starts Friday and lasts through the Sunday after Thanksgiving. (AAA's forecast looks at the Wednesday to Sunday period.)

""I wouldn't say there's any worry because we planned for this for months in advance,"" TSA Administrator David Pekoske told CNN's Pete Muntean. ""We have a lot of data, we work very closely with the carriers and the airports, so we know what to anticipate and then we staff to the volumes that we expect to see.""

The TSA anticipates the Sunday after Thanksgiving will likely see the highest numbers thanks to a rush of travelers returning home, but they will probably not reach the all-time record set on the same day in 2019 when 2.9 million people were screened at airports.

Air travelers should definitely be prepared for crowds, said Andrew Gross, spokesperson for AAA.

""So we're telling people, look, you're going to find lines at the airport. It's just inevitable. So get there that old-fashioned at least two hours early. And if it's an international flight, three hours early.""

The possibility of major disruptions should be a consideration, and AAA recommends travel insurance.

""Get that trip insurance and that airline insurance if you can. That little box you often skip, click it this year because we don't know what staffing levels are going to be like for the airlines and for TSA,"" Gross said.

Insurance coverage can generally be purchased up until the day prior to a traveler's departure, according to travel insurance comparison site Squaremouth

Other tips for flying:

-- Fly early in the day to avoid the cascading effect of delays and cancellations. Bad weather is also more likely to affect later flights

-- Try the airline website or app to get rebooked if your flight is canceled. It's usually faster, according to Kathleen Bangs, a former airline pilot and spokesperson for FlightAware

-- Book nonstop flights offered several times a day on major carriers to up your odds of getting rebooked on the same itinerary in a timely manner, Orlando said

-- To be really safe, book a backup flight

""Personally, I often buy two tickets, and the second ticket is kept as a back-up reserve,"" said FlightAware's Bangs.

She makes sure the second flight is refundable or reusable, and that it's at least two hours later than the first so she has time to make it if the other one is seriously delayed or canceled.

Hitting the road

With so many people vaccinated, AAA's Gross is expecting roads to feel like a typical Thanksgiving: ""Crowded. Busy.""

""If you leave Wednesday afternoon before Thanksgiving and you live near a big metropolitan area, you're going to be sitting in that old-fashioned traffic again,"" Gross said.

Average gas prices are about $1.30 higher than last year. ""But as we've always discovered, no matter how much gasoline prices are, people are still going to take that trip. They'll just budget along the way,"" Gross said.

AAA tips for driving:

-- Make sure your vehicle is ready. AAA suggests getting key components like the battery, fuel system, tires, brakes and fluid levels checked

-- Mornings over the holiday weekend are generally better times to drive. Wednesday's best time is after 9 p.m., according to transportation analytics firm INRIX. Wednesday's worst time is between noon and 8 p.m.

Covid-19 health considerations for holiday travel in 2021

For those traveling with unvaccinated people, the agency suggests safer options such as road trips with few stops and direct flights.

Traveling with children who are unvaccinated will be a consideration for many families.

""This risk is not so much the travel itself but what you do at the destination,"" said Dr. Leana Wen, a CNN medical analyst, emergency physician and professor of health policy and management at the George Washington University Milken Institute School of Public Health.

Trips involving visits to crowded indoor attractions and restaurants are higher risk.

""Travel itself can be made very safe, especially if the younger children are able to mask. If they're unable to mask, that is a major barrier,"" said Wen, who is also author of a new book, ""Lifelines: A Doctor's Journey in the Fight for Public Health.""

If she were traveling only with her 4-year-old son, who is used to masking at preschool, Wen said she would feel very comfortable taking him on a short flight. However, she would not travel on a plane or train with her daughter who is 1 1/2, because she can't consistently mask.

People should be wearing a high-quality mask -- N95, KN95 or KF94 -- anytime they're in crowded indoor settings with people of unknown vaccination status, she said.

Many families are coming together this holiday season for the first time in a long time. CNN's Dr. Sanjay Gupta shares these tips on how to protect your loved ones from getting Covid-19.

Gathering safely when you get there

The vaccination status of everyone else is key when you have unvaccinated children in the mix.

""If you are planning to see relatives who are all vaccinated and be outdoors or around other people known to be vaccinated, that's much lower risk than if you're planning to be in indoor crowded spaces with people of unknown vaccination status,"" Wen said.

If the gathering involves immunocompromised family members or unvaccinated children, or both, Wen suggests that everyone quarantine for at least three days before getting together and taking a rapid test just prior to seeing each other.

""That would reduce the risk for everyone,"" she said. And those eligible for booster shots should get them, Wen advised.

Beyond pandemic health precautions, patience will be essential for holiday travel. Flight delays, cancellations and staffing challenges are to be expected right now, said travel adviser Dave Hershberger, president of Prestige Travel Leaders in Cincinnati."

Here are some things we learned in pandemic travel this week.

1. Russia has moved to the CDC's highest-risk category

Moscow will impose a 10-day lockdown from next week in an effort to curb soaring Covid-19 cases, the city's mayor has said, as Russia endures its worst-ever phase of the pandemic. CNN's Frederik Pleitgen reports.

Covid cases in the world's largest country by area have hit a record high , with close to 274,000 new cases reported in Russia in the past week and only 34% of the population fully vaccinated.

The rise means that the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) this week added Russia to its list of ""very high"" risk travel destinations , the criteria for which is having had more than 500 cases per 100,000 residents in the past 28 days.

There are now nearly 80 countries on the CDC's ""no-go"" Level 4 list, including the UK, Greece, Switzerland and Thailand.

2. China is doubling down on its zero-Covid strategy

Shanghai Disneyland went into a snap lockdown after a single Covid-19 case was confirmed. The extreme measure saw tens of thousands of visitors and staff forced to undergo coronavirus testing before they were allowed to leave the park, as police blocked the exits and secured the grounds. CNN's David Culver reports.

All across Asia Pacific, from Australia to South Korea, countries are easing restrictions and reopening borders as they move away from zero-Covid strategies -- but China is holding out.

The country is working to contain its most widespread Covid outbreak since Wuhan, although recent case numbers are still only in the hundreds. A single Covid case at Shanghai Disneyland at Halloween sent the whole park and adjacent Disneytown shopping district into lockdown.

Despite fully vaccinating more than 75% of its population, China is sticking to its policy of closed borders, lengthy quarantines for international arrivals and localized lockdowns.

3. Flying has gotten really bad. Here's why

American Airlines has canceled hundreds of flights over a four day period as it deals with staffing shortages and weather issues. The airline says 1,800 flight attendants are returning from pandemic time-off. CNN's Pete Muntean reports.

Staffing shortages mean flight crews are overworked and vaccine mandates could lead to even more shortages. Lower availability of flights, meanwhile, means higher ticket prices for those flights. Planes are packed, there's division over mask rules, and tensions are rising.

Meanwhile, the US will reopen to fully vaccinated foreign visitors on November 8. ""It's going to be a bit sloppy at first, I can assure you,"" Delta Air Lines CEO Ed Bastian said at a late October travel industry conference. ""There will be lines, unfortunately.""

4. The ultra long-haul dream hasn't gone away

An experimental 2019 research flight by Qantas landed in Sydney after flying nonstop from London, breaking two aviation records.

Ultra long-haul flights are classed as any that are scheduled to last more than 16 hours -- and they've actually been around since the 1930s.

While the aviation industry is focused on recovery rather than bum-numbing record-breaking, Qantas CEO Alan Joyce has told CNN's Richard Quest that in 2022 his airline hopes to revisit development of Project Sunrise -- a plan to operate the world's longest nonstop flights, which would allow travelers to fly between London or New York to the eastern Australia cities of Sydney and Melbourne. The aim is to then launch in the following two to three years.

The world's longest scheduled passenger flight currently in service is Singapore Airlines' Singapore-JFK flight, which covers 9,536.5 miles and takes 18 hours and 40 minutes on the Singapore-bound route.

5. Try warm-weather destinations, say travel experts

Relax and enjoy the surf and sun by taking a 60 second break in Turks & Caicos.

While the 2020 holiday season was a stay-at-home affair, this year moving around the world is safer and more accessible. However, we still need weigh up risks versus benefits during every step of vacation-planning.

CNN Travel asked industry experts and CNN medical analyst Dr. Leana Wen about what you need to consider when making those destination decisions.

Your vaccination status is the most important factor when it comes to ease of travel, with many countries not letting the unjabbed enter. If you want to reduce your Covid risk but are still keen for a vacation abroad, consider warm-weather destinations where most of the activity is outdoors.

7. The 'world's best' cheese for 2021 was revealed

The World Cheese Awards 2021 were held in northern Spain. The Guild of Fine Food

Even if you're not making plans to jet off anywhere for a while, you can still travel the world with your palate.

A soft goat's cheese from Spain won first place at the World Cheese Awards on November 3, having been chosen out of more than 4,000 entries from more than 40 countries.

The winning cheese, called Olavidia, is from an artisan cheesemaker using the commercial name Quesos y Besos (Cheeses and Kisses). The crown returned to Europe this year after the previous winner was -- for the first time ever -- an American cheese, Oregon's Rogue River Blue.

8. There were joyful reunions at Australian airports

Australia's international borders have reopened , ending nearly 20 months of tough restrictions and sparking emotional scenes at the Sydney airport as people were reunited with their loved ones. CNN's Angus Watson reports.

Tens of thousands of loved ones and family members have been kept apart for more than 20 months due to Australia's strict border policy in response to Covid-19.

When the country's i nternational borders finally reopened on November 1, there were hugs, tears and emotional reunions at Sydney and Melbourne airports."

""I realize I'm in the crosshairs of the woke mob right now,"" Rodgers said. ""So, before my final nail gets put in my cancel culture casket, I think I would like to set the record straight on so many of the blatant lies that are out there about myself.""

Rodgers said the media was on a ""witch hunt"" to find out which players were vaccinated and blamed reporters for him saying he was ""immunized"" back in August.

While talking with McAfee on his SiriusXM show, the three-time MVP repeated some Covid-19 misconceptions and said he has conferred with podcast host Joe Rogan on how to deal with a coronavirus infection.

The quarterback, who has led Green Bay to a 7-1 record, will not play in the Packers game against the Kansas City Chiefs this weekend due to Covid-19 protocols, the team's head coach Matt LaFleur announced Wednesday.

The 37-year-old Rodgers said if any reporter would have asked a follow-up question, he would have explained he's ""not an anti-vax flat earther,"" but that he's a ""critical thinker.""

Rogers added he has been following the strict NFL protocols for unvaccinated players to a ""T."" Rodgers described the daily testing he is subjected to every day, even on off days, and believes the rules are in place to shame unvaccinated people. Rodgers said he has been tested over 300 times before testing positive this week.

Rodgers said he experienced some mild symptoms for roughly 48 hours but currently ""feels really good."" He wasn't certain when he would return to the field or what protocols were in place for him now that he tested positive for the novel coronavirus.

Quarterback took advice from Joe Rogan

Rodgers said he consulted with podcast host Joe Rogan and took his advice on how he treated his own Covid-19.

""I consulted with a now good friend of mine, Joe Rogan, after he got Covid, and I've a lot of the stuff he recommended in his podcast and on the phone to me,"" Rodgers said.

""I'm going to have the best immunity possible now based on the 2.5-million-person study from Israel that the people that get Covid and recover, have the most robust immunity. I'm thankful for people like Joe stepping up and using his voice. I'm thankful for my medical squad and I'm thankful for all the love and support I've gotten but I've been taking monoclonal antibodies, ivermectin, zinc, vitamin C and DHCQ and I feel pretty incredible.""

Of these, only monoclonal antibodies are approved treatments for Covid-19 but those alone could account for any improvement in his symptoms.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention noted an Israeli study looked at people who had been vaccinated six months before or longer. ""Understanding infection-induced and vaccine-induced immunity over time is important, particularly for future studies to consider,"" they wrote

Rodgers said he did not get vaccinated because he has an allergy to an ingredient in the Moderna and Pfizer vaccines and was scared about the possible side effects from the Johnson & Johnson vaccine. He said the decision to seek alternative treatments was ""what was best for my body.""

Rodgers said the NFL knew he was unvaccinated, and he had multiple conversations with NFL doctors including one where a doctor told him, ""it is impossible for a vaccinated person to get Covid or spread Covid.""

When asked about Aaron Rodgers' claim that a NFL doctor told him ""it is impossible for vaccinated person to get Covid or spread Covid,"" a league source tells CNN ""no doctor from the league or the joint NFL-NFLPA infectious disease consultants communicated with the player.""

Rodgers told McAfee he had previously tried to ""petition"" the league that his homeopathic treatment of increasing his antibodies should be considered as an alternative to getting fully vaccinated via Moderna, Pfizer or Johnson & Johnson vaccines.

Rodgers continued, ""at that point I knew I was definitely not going to win the appeal.""

CNN has asked the NFL about this claim and whether the league has a comment.

There is no evidence that homeopathic treatments can affect a person's antibodies, experts say.

McAfee, a former NFL player and WWE wrestler turned sports commentator, said on Twitter in August he tested positive for a breakthrough case of Covid-19 despite being fully vaccinated.

Vaccines better than previous infections, CDC says

Rodgers said, ""The vaccines do offer some protection for sure but there is a lot we don't know about them. ... There is a lot to natural immunity. ... If you have gotten Covid and recovered from it, that's the best boost to immunity you can have.""

Rodgers is not incorrect in thinking people who have recovered from Covid-19 have some immunity -- but it's not nearly as much immunity as vaccinated people have. A team of researchers led by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported in October that vaccination protects people against coronavirus infection much better than previous infection does.

Their study found people who had not been vaccinated and who ended up in the hospital were five times more likely to have Covid-19 than people who had been vaccinated within the past three to six months.

""All eligible persons should be vaccinated against COVID-19 as soon as possible, including unvaccinated persons previously infected with SARS-CoV-2,"" the researchers wrote in the CDC's weekly report, the MMWR.

Rodgers expresses doubts

The Green Bay quarterback paraphrased Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. while explaining his stance, ""The great MLK said that 'You have a moral obligation to object to unjust rules and rules that make no sense.'"" Rodgers said certain strict NFL protocols were not based on science, noting if he tested negative for Covid-19 every day and was surrounded by vaccinated people, why should he be ""shamed"" into wearing a mask throughout the Packers facility.

In August, Rodgers was asked whether he had received the Covid-19 vaccine. Rodgers said he had been ""immunized.""

""There's a lot of conversation around it, around the league, and a lot of guys who have made statements and not made statements,"" Rodgers said. ""Owners have made statements. There's guys on the team that haven't been vaccinated. I think it's personal decision. I'm not going to judge those guys. There's guys that have been vaccinated and contracted Covid. So it's an interesting issue.""

The NFL said it is reviewing the situation. A league spokesperson told CNN in a statement, ""The primary responsibility for enforcement of the Covid Protocols within Club facilities rests with each Club.

""Failure to properly enforce the protocols has resulted in discipline being assessed against individual Clubs in the past. The league is aware of the current situation in Green Bay and will be reviewing with the Packers.""

Vaccinated players who test positive and remain asymptomatic are eligible to return after testing negative twice in a 24-hour span. Unvaccinated players are required to quarantine for 10 days and then test negative to return."

This development follows the US Food and Drug Administration approval last Friday of emergency use authorization for Pfizer-BioNTech's vaccine for that age group. This cohort of younger children can begin receiving these shots as early as this week.

Grown-ups have a lot of questions. What dose are their kids getting, and how long will it take to kick in and protect their children? What side effects should they expect? What if their child is about to turn 12 -- should they wait until then to get the higher dose? And what happens if the pediatrician's office doesn't have vaccine appointments -- what other options are there to get a shot?

I posed these questions to CNN Medical Analyst Dr. Leana Wen, an emergency physician and professor of health policy and management at the George Washington University Milken Institute School of Public Health. She is also author of a new book, "" Lifelines: A Doctor's Journey in the Fight for Public Health ,"" and the mother of two young kids.

CNN: What dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine did the FDA and CDC authorize for children ages 5 to 11, and how long will it take for kids to be considered fully vaccinated?

Dr. Leana Wen: The dosage authorized for this younger age group is 10 micrograms, which is one-third the dose given to adults and kids age 12 and older (30 micrograms). Similar to how it's administered to older individuals, the vaccine is given in two doses, spaced at least 21 days apart. Kids are considered fully vaccinated two weeks after they receive the second dose.

CNN: What kind of side effects should kids expect?

Wen: In the clinical trial involving more than 3,000 kids 5 to 11 years old who received the vaccine, side effects were similar to the kinds seen in adults. The most common side effects are soreness at the injection site, fatigue and headache. Some children can experience fever and chills. All of these side effects subside within a couple of days. In fact, the risks of these In the clinical trial involving more than 3,000 kids 5 to 11 years old who received the vaccine, side effects were similar to the kinds seen in adults. The most common side effects are soreness at the injection site, fatigue and headache. Some children can experience fever and chills. All of these side effects subside within a couple of days. In fact, the risks of these side effects were lower in the younger kids than in adults -- probably because of the lower dose.

In the clinical trial, there were no cases of myocarditis, or inflammation of the heart muscle, that is seen in very rare cases, predominantly in older children and adolescents. This condition is, in theory, still a possible risk, but expected to be extremely rare. The chance of myocarditis from Covid-19 is expected to be higher than the chance of myocarditis from the vaccine.

Some parents may be worried about long-term side effects. There is no scientific reason to think that this would happen. Side effects from other immunizations occur within the first two or three weeks following the shots, not months afterward.

CNN: Should parents and families plan on kids missing school to recover from potential side effects after they get the vaccine?

Wen: That's up to you. A lot of kids have minimal side effects and will have no problem going to school the next day. On the other hand, if you are worried about childcare, in case your child has to miss school and then you may have to miss work, it's reasonable to schedule the shots on a Friday or weekend.

CNN: Can a child get the Covid-19 vaccine the same time as another vaccine, like the flu vaccine?

Wen: Yes. If given at the same time, the vaccines would be given in a different injection site -- for example, in the other arm, or in two different places on the leg.

CNN: What if a child has a history of food or medication allergies? Should they skip this vaccine?

Wen: No. The only reason not to get this vaccine is if your child has a severe allergic reaction to one of its components. Note that the Covid-19 vaccines do not contain egg products, as some other vaccines do. If your child has a food allergy or had a reaction to another vaccine in the past, that is not a reason to refrain from the Covid-19 vaccine.

Kids ages 5 to 11 can soon receive the Pfizer-BioNTech Covid-19 vaccine, following CDC Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky's approval of that recommendation.

If you are particularly concerned, mention it to your pediatrician or pharmacist. These health professionals can observe your child in the office or pharmacy for longer following the vaccine just to make sure there is no allergic reaction.

CNN: Should a child who has had Covid-19 before still get vaccinated?

Wen: The CDC recommends that individuals who previously were diagnosed with Covid-19 still get vaccinated. The vaccine provides additional, longer-lasting protection than recovery from illness.

There are some experts who believe that someone who has had Covid-19 only needs one shot of the vaccine. However, this is not the CDC recommendation, which is to receive two doses of the vaccine regardless of prior infection.

CNN: What about healthy kids -- should they still be vaccinated?

Wen: Yes. About one-third of the children who have been hospitalized from Covid-19 are those with no underlying health conditions. Healthy children can become very sick from coronavirus and would also benefit from the vaccine.

CNN: What happens if the pediatrician's office says their appointments are already booked?

Wen: I know a lot of parents are very eager to get their kids vaccinated -- I would be, too, if my kids were old enough! I'd first ask the pediatrician's office when their next appointments will be. Are we talking a matter of waiting a few days or multiple weeks? If it's just days, I'd wait, but if it's weeks, I'd ask to be put on the waitlist and then call around to explore other options.

Call all your local pharmacies, both chains and independent pharmacies. Make sure to mention your child's exact age, as some places may not give shots to young kids. If they are not sure yet, call back the next day -- a lot is changing very quickly. Your local health department may have information on vaccine clinics. And ask your school administrator and other families, too, for recommendations.

CNN: We get this question a lot -- should families with 11-year-olds wait until their kids turn 12 to get the higher dose, or go ahead and get the lower dose now?

Wen: This was an extensive topic of conversation at the CDC meeting on Tuesday. The CDC recommends that children receive the appropriate dose for their age at the time of inoculation. If a child is just about to turn 12, they could get the 10-microgram dose for their first dose and the 30-microgram dose for the second.

It's important to note that vaccines are not weight-based. The 10-microgram dose, in the younger age group, was found to be optimal when it comes to both effectiveness and lower side effects. In the older age group, the 30-microgram dosage is what was studied. There probably isn't a major difference for an 11 or 12-year-old to get 10 versus 30 micrograms.

CNN: Is there any reason to wait for the Moderna vaccine or Johnson & Johnson in this age group?

Wen: No. These other vaccines are not authorized for emergency use in this younger age group, and, in fact, the data has not even been submitted for federal health officials to review. It may take months for the FDA and CDC to review those applications. I would highly recommend that you vaccinate your children with what is available now, which is a safe and highly effective vaccine from Pfizer-BioNTech.

CNN: Should parents with children younger than 5 still take additional precautions, even after an older sibling is able to be vaccinated?

Wen: Yes, because there will still be a child in the house who remains too young to be vaccinated. That said, families can decide that once an older child is vaccinated, he or she can resume some activities that were put on hold before. A sleepover with others who are fully vaccinated, for example, is now much lower risk, as are sports and extracurriculars with other vaccinated kids.

CNN: What would you say to people who don't believe Covid-19 is a real threat to children?

Get CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.

Wen: I'd refer them to the data. There have been more than 1.9 million cases of Covid-19 in this younger age group, according to the data presented at the CDC meeting. More than 8,300 children have been hospitalized. There have been over 2,300 cases of multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children, or MIS-C, which could cause severe organ damage with long-term consequences. Covid-19 is now one of the top 10 leading causes of death in this age group.

We now have a vaccine that is over 90% effective at preventing Covid-19 in younger children. All of us want to do what's best for children. I hope parents and families will take advantage of this free and safe vaccine, giving our kids protection -- and adults much-needed peace of mind."

London (CNN Business) For about 20 months, central banks have funneled an unprecedented amount of cash into the financial system, aiming to limit the worst effects of the Covid-19 pandemic on the economy. Now, with an eye on inflation , they're changing course — with big ramifications for stocks and bonds.

What's happening: The US Federal Reserve said Wednesday that it will begin to reduce asset purchases, a key part of its stimulus efforts, by $15 billion each month. The program is set to wrap up by the middle of 2022.

It's not alone. Australia's central bank also took steps to tighten monetary policy this week, while the Bank of Canada said last week it would stop expanding its balance sheet. The European Central Bank is also slowing the pace of its purchases this quarter.

Given the policy shifts, you would think investors might be panicking. After all, the amount of cash in the system has been the major force behind market euphoria following the pandemic crash.

""The main driver in the market today, it's this phenomenal pool of liquidity, "" Vis Raghavan, JPMorgan's CEO for Europe, the Middle East and Africa, told me this week. ""The market is just awash with money. Every asset class is exceptionally busy.""

But there's been no ""taper tantrum"" as there was in 2013, when the Fed signaled that it would eventually decelerate asset purchases, sparking a sharp bond selloff and global market turbulence. The Dow, S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite all hit all-time highs on Wednesday, and the bond market is holding steady.

Why? First, the messaging has been extremely clear. Raghavan thinks it's also evident that central banks would be willing to go all-in again should the post-pandemic recovery go south. After 2020, their willingness to flex their muscle is no secret.

""No one wants any economic tumult to sack this recovery,"" he said. ""Whatever happens, there will be intervention to assure there's no economic pain.""

Fed Chair Jerome Powell — who last year saw the central bank's balance sheet grow to $7.4 trillion, the highest level on record — indicated as much on Wednesday.

""We are prepared to adjust the pace of purchases if warranted by changes in the economic outlook,"" he said.

But with inflation rising at the fastest rate in three decades, the question now is whether central banks will need to taper stimulus even more aggressively or risk missing their moment to keep a lid on price increases. That will require careful communication to keep investors on the same page.

Powell said the Fed won't raise interest rates until the labor market makes more progress. But does the central bank risk getting left behind?

Watch this space: There was a chance the Bank of England would become the first major central bank to raise interest rates since the crisis hit on Thursday — but it held rates steady at a record low 0.1%. Bank of America's team thinks the central bank will hike rates twice by February.

OPEC is under serious pressure to pump more crude

Even as the world debates the end of fossil fuels at COP26 in Glasgow, OPEC and its allies are discussing whether to pump more oil to ease soaring prices that are fueling global inflation and hurting vulnerable households.

The latest: Energy ministers from major producers including Saudi Arabia and Russia meeting virtually on Thursday are under pressure from big customers such as the United States to increase production by more than the planned 400,000 barrels per day, my CNN Business colleague Charles Riley reports.

Speaking earlier this week at the climate summit in Glasgow, President Joe Biden said that rising gasoline prices are ""a consequence"" of ""the refusal of Russia or the OPEC nations to pump more oil.""

""We'll see what happens on that score sooner than later,"" Biden added.

Step back: The price of Brent crude oil, the global benchmark, has doubled over the past year to more than $83 per barrel as the global economy rebounds from its pandemic slump. Bank of America predicts that prices will zoom even higher and hit $120 per barrel by June 2022.

Soaring oil prices would dampen the recovery at a crucial moment, and elevated gasoline prices could have political ramifications for Democrats heading into the 2022 midterm elections. US gas prices have surged to a seven-year high of $3.40 a gallon nationally and are flirting with $4 in Nevada, Washington and Oregon.

Remember: OPEC member countries produce about 40% of the world's crude oil. OPEC has been coordinating production decisions in recent years with other major producers including Russia as part of a larger grouping called OPEC+.

""The external flex on OPEC+ from oil-producing countries is mounting, especially from the United States,"" said Rystad Energy analyst Louise Dickson.

Web Summit CEO says regulators should look to China

Looking to put the pandemic behind them, more than 40,000 people are in Lisbon for Web Summit, Europe's largest tech festival.

A lot of them are talking about Facebook. Whistleblower Frances Haugen kicked off the event Monday by asserting the company would be ""stronger"" if founder Mark Zuckerberg stepped down as chief executive. On Wednesday, Chris Cox, Facebook's chief product officer, said that the social media giant welcomed ""difficult conversations.""

""It's good for us and it's good for society,"" he said, while touting the company's pivot to virtual and augmented reality technologies. ""We are not perfect.""

Web Summit CEO Paddy Cosgrave told me that the arrival of whistleblowers on the scene is helping regulators build momentum.

""They're moving faster than they've ever moved before to write legislation to begin to address some of these problems,"" he said in an interview.

One potential model? Cosgrave thinks regulators should look to China, which he said is implementing ""very sensible policies"" related to social media and protecting children.

Earlier this year, Beijing barred online gamers under the age of 18 from playing on weekdays. Douyin, the Chinese version of TikTok, is introducing a ""teenage mode"" limiting the amount of time children under the age of 14 can spend on the app — a move seen as an attempt to get ahead of potential regulation.

(CNN) Green Bay Packers star quarterback Aaron Rodgers typically makes headlines for his outstanding plays on the field. Earlier this year, he was named the NFL's MVP of the year for the third time in recognition of his remarkable performance in the 2020 season, and before Sunday's loss to the Kansas City Chiefs, Rodgers' Packers were tied for the best record in the league. To achieve that success, Rodgers has not only shown an amazing level of talent but also true leadership.

Dean Obeidallah

In jaw-dropping contrast, Rodgers' response following the news last week that he was unvaccinated and contracted Covid-19 has been the opposite of a strong leader. While appearing on SiriusXM's ""The Pat McAfee Show"" on Friday, he lashed out at critics as a ""woke mob,"" spewed medically unsound concerns on Covid-19 vaccines and failed to apologize for seemingly misleading people in August that he had been vaccinated.

""At the time, my plan was to say I'd been immunized; it wasn't some sort of ruse,"" Rodgers said.""I believe strongly in bodily autonomy and the ability to make choices for your body, not to have to acquiesce to some woke-culture-crazed group of individuals who say you have to do something,"" although he did note that he has followed the protocols for unvaccinated players to a T.

Rodgers' reaction to the fallout has been more akin to the Trumpian tactic of refusing to take responsibility for past wrongs and instead attacking one's critics. Rodgers should -- and must -- be better than that, both for his teammates and for his legion of fans who admire him and even see him as a role model.

There's just so much wrong with what Rodgers said on McAfee's show. For starters, Rodgers shared that he's taken medical advice from a comedian. And not just any comedian, but Joe Rogan -- the same person who was slammed in April for his inaccurate comments that 21-year-olds shouldn't get vaccinated if they are a ""healthy person."""

""I think I did about 18 flights in quite a short space of time,"" the 29-year-old tells CNN Travel today.

For Wolf, seeing that number written down forced some hard reflection.

""I was quite a big polluter,"" she says.

Wolf had never given much thought to the impact of flying before, but this was a turning point. She swore off aviation.

""I've not been on a plane since.""

To cement her commitment, Wolf signed a 2020 no-flying pledge organized by Flight Free UK -- a campaign group that promotes alternative forms of travel beyond aviation -- unaware that air travel was about to be off limits for much of that year and the next.

By spring 2020, air travel around the world had ground to a halt.

As the skies emptied of planes, the term ""staycation"" became omnipresent. And even as international travel resumed in fitful intervals last year and this year, many travelers continued to look closer to home for their vacation thrills amid the uncertain global landscape.

Heading in 2022, Covid remains a threat, but borders continue to reopen and international travel is steadily returning.

But while many count down the days until they next board a plane, other eco-conscious travelers like Wolf are committed to remaining flight free forever.

Rethinking the norm

Wolf, who is based in England, doesn't see her pledge to avoid air travel as being at odds with her desire to explore the world.

""I'm still very keen on travel, I still will travel, I will just use alternative means,"" she says.

Wolf's long-term partner is also committed to a flight-free lifestyle. Summer 2020 saw the couple head to the south of France by train, a journey they repeated this past August. They also recently spent a weekend break in Edinburgh, eschewing the cheap flights to Scotland in favor of the train journey north.

Long-term, the couple hope to one day travel from the UK to Japan via the Trans-Siberian Railway.

However while Wolf is keen to avoid flying, she's not ruling out ever stepping on board a plane again.

She's half-British, half-American, and has family in the US.

Charlotte Wolf “I'm still very keen on travel, I still will travel, I will just use alternative means”

""When I was younger, I used to go about five times a year to New York, whereas now I think I'd be happy to go every five years for an essential reason,"" Wolf explains.

Right now, Wolf thinks it would be acceptable to travel by plane to see them every half decade or so. She'd also fly in the event of an emergency. But she won't be flying for leisure again.

Wolf admits it's easier to make this commitment because she's traveled so extensively already.

""I think it's a privilege thing, and I think that I wouldn't expect people to do it if they hadn't seen the world,"" she says. ""I'm very lucky to have done the bucket list thing at my age.""

Wolf also understands the appeal of low cost airfares over pricey trains, suggesting there needs to be a broader overhaul of travel costs.

She's also aware that as a self-employed person, it's easier for her to take the ""long route"" on vacation, and suggests there should be government-backed incentives to encourage people to travel by rail.

""Obviously if you're going to France by train [from the UK], it's a day each way for the travel, whereas if you fly, it's a bit different. So I think we'd be interested to see things like incentives in salary jobs, where you get more annual leave, if you can evidence that you're taking a low carbon option.""

While Wolf doesn't expect everyone to follow in her footsteps, she does tag her travel photos with #flightfree. She wants to ""participate in that dialogue"" and show people how easy it is to travel from the UK to Europe -- and beyond -- by rail.

Flight-free movement

Travelers across the globe have committed to becoming flight free for 2022 and beyond. Boris Roessler/picture alliance/dpa/Getty Images

Flight Free UK was inspired by the Swedish ""Flygfritt"" (flight-free) movement, which grew in prominence in 2019, around the time the Swedish term ""flygskam"" (flight shame) entered common parlance. Flight Free UK encourages people to sign an annual pledge to remain flight-free for a year, as Wolf did.

The campaign group is also part of Stay Grounded , a global network of organizations founded in 2016 to encourage a move away from air travel.

While Flygfritt may have become more talked about in the last five years, for Flight Free UK director Anna Hughes, shunning flying isn't a new phenomenon: Hughes took her last ever flight 12 years ago.

""I have done so many flight-free adventures and lots of very exciting travel without flying that I don't feel that I'm missing out in the slightest, I don't see it as a sacrifice, I see it as a positive aspect of my lifestyle,"" Hughes tells CNN Travel.

It was the 2018 IPCC report and its stark findings that prompted Hughes to become more vocal about her commitment to avoid aviation.

""I decided that it wasn't good enough just to be doing my own thing, I needed to encourage lots of other people to do the same.""

How successful Hughes' campaign has been is hard to judge, she admits, due to the context of the Covid-19 pandemic -- Flight Free UK only launched in 2019.

The impact of Covid-19 on the flight-free movement is also hard to quantify, says Hughes. But as she starts to encourage people to pledge for 2022, she says there are ""two distinct camps"" of travelers.

""There will be many people with that pent up demand for travel,"" she says. ""On the other hand, there will be many people [where] this will have been a bit of a reset for them. So to have been forced to stay local perhaps will have opened their eyes to some of the things that are here on our doorstep.""

Hughes and her team are trying to celebrate and promote the idea of the return of conscious decision-making around travel.

""Covid has removed our choice this year, we have been forced to stay grounded because of the pandemic,"" says Hughes.

""Going forward in the future, could we make these decisions through choice? When travel opens up again, can we make a free choice to explore in other ways? Because the climate crisis is as big a crisis as the pandemic, if not more.""

Hughes also supports change coming from above -- she's in favor of a tax on aviation fuel to clamp down on cheap flights.

And while Hughes is skeptical about concrete change concerning aviation coming out of COP26, she does think individual action could lead to a broader industry and government shift.

Hughes makes the comparison with the increasing omnipresence of veganism in the UK.

Hughes became a vegan around the time she swore off flying. A decade ago, she says she'd receive blank looks when she asked restaurants about their vegan options.

""Now I get given a menu,"" she says.

""If enough people do it, if customer patterns kind of shift, then industry responds.""

View from America

Flight Free UK also has an American sister organization, also part of the global Stay Grounded movement.

Dan Castrigano, of Flight Free USA, tells CNN Travel that the American movement is smaller than its European counterparts, hampered by a lack of train infrastructure in the US.

But while rejecting aviation when traveling domestically in the US might be harder, some Americans are still trying to make it work.

Betsy Thagard, 59, recently traveled from California to Chicago to visit family, and made the trip largely by rail.

""Two years ago is when I first declared I would be flight free,"" says Thagard. ""Then, of course, we couldn't travel anywhere for 18 months, because of Covid. So this trip that I'm in the middle of was the first one I've taken since I made that declaration.""

While switching from plane to rail meant a longer journey, and more planning, Thagard says she's enjoyed seeing the US by train.

Betsy Thagard “It makes you start focusing on your local places -- what can we do to keep our local places beautiful -- instead of having to fly somewhere else, to see someone else's beautiful local place.”

""I've been flying back and forth to see [my family] for decades now, and so deciding to go flight free meant a real change of life for me, but I love it.""

However Thagard says she had to do one leg of the journey by plane.

""There was only one train that went from Charlotte [in North Carolina] to Birmingham [in Alabama] and it left at three o'clock in the morning,"" she says.

Thagard didn't feel comfortable waiting alone at a train station at that time.

""So I had to fly that one leg, and that was very disappointing,"" she says.

It's for this reason that Thagard hopes that the US government will expand the country's railway network to make avoiding airplanes easier.

While Thagard traveled a lot when she was younger, she says there are some destinations she's not visited, and she says she may now struggle to see these places, given her commitment to being flight free.

""I always wanted to go to New Zealand, I always wanted to go to Prague, I'm never going to go to those places now -- unless I can find a boat to take me, because I know I wouldn't enjoy it, knowing that I was destroying the very places that I wanted to see by flying there,"" she says.

Thagard says this makes her a little sad, but she's ready to appreciate the beauty of California, where she lives, and the surrounding western states.

""I've got all kinds of places I can go in the west of the United States that are just as beautiful as anywhere in the world. So it makes you start focusing on your local places -- what can we do to keep our local places beautiful -- instead of having to fly somewhere else, to see someone else's beautiful local place.""

Plus, Prague might not be out of the question. When Thagard retires, she hopes to travel across the Atlantic on the Queen Mary 2, and then explore Europe by rail.

Like Wolf in the UK, Thagard is aware that it's a privilege to be able to take your time traveling by rail or boat -- she's also self-employed and able to manage her own time.

But Thagard wants to encourage others whose jobs and lifestyle allow it to embrace slow travel.

""The journey, the getting from here to there, is part of the pleasure of the trip. It's not just this unpleasant step you have to take in order to arrive somewhere else,"" she says.

""It's important to get out there that it's fun."""

(CNN) Rich countries around the world are expanding their Covid-19 booster programs amid concerns about waning vaccine immunity, a rise in cases and the approach of winter.

In the United States, Pfizer-BioNTech are seeking emergency use authorization from the US Food and Drug Administration for the booster to be distributed to all people aged 18 and over. The drug makers said on Tuesday that results of a Phase 3 trial involving 10,000 participants provided ""stunning"" results in favor of a third shot. Boosters had an efficacy of 95% against symptomatic Covid-19, they said, compared with the two-dose schedule.

Boosters are already currently available for many Americans. People over 65 and those in certain jobs such as teachers and health care workers, as well as those who are overweight, have depression or a long list of other medical conditions are already eligible -- accounting for at least 89% of vaccinated adults, according to an analysis by epidemiologists for CNN. If regulators expand the booster program to all adults, it will move the US closer towards President Joe Biden's wider-reaching booster plan, which he's advocated for since August.

European leaders are also prioritizing booster shots as the continent marks a worrying surge in recent cases. The region is once again the ""epicenter"" of the pandemic, with the World Health Organization (WHO) saying on Thursday that Europe had seen a more than 50% jump in Covid cases in the past month.

In France, nearly 150,000 people booked appointments for booster doses after French President Emmanuel Macron said on Tuesday that a third dose would be required to revalidate one's health pass. The country's health pass has been an essential tool for the government in boosting vaccination rates, banning entry to public transport and a variety of public and private spaces for those without proof of full vaccination. People over 65 will have to show proof of a third shot by mid-December, Macron said. That age group has been able to access booster shots since the beginning of September.

And in Germany, health officials expanded its booster vaccine program to all adults on Friday, following a ""worrying"" record in daily infections. On Monday, Germany recorded its highest seven-day incidence rate since the pandemic began.

Meanwhile, the world's poorest countries continue to bear the brunt of an inequitable global rollout, with a rise in booster shots only amplifying that stark disparity.

In the United Kingdom, for example, 74% of its population have had at least one dose, 67% have gotten two doses, and 15% of the population have already received a booster shot. In contrast, only 9% of people in African countries on average have had a first dose, according to Our World in Data. Only 6.29% of Africa is fully vaccinated, the data shows

WHO warns that vaccine inequality will prolong the pandemic, with senior leader Dr. Bruce Aylward saying last month that such disparities could see the pandemic ""easily drag on deep into 2022.""

YOU ASKED, WE ANSWERED

Q: Which booster shot should I get?

A: For the most part, For the most part, it doesn't matter . Studies indicate it's all right to mix and match vaccine doses. In some cases it may provide a more powerful boost to get a different vaccine type, but any booster dose will bring immune protection up to very high levels.

Some of the initial data suggests that boosting with a different vaccine type from your initial series might provide a stronger response -- but it's only preliminary data. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says they assume most people will just have the same vaccine they got originally as a booster -- and that would be fine. All the groups in an ongoing study by the US National Institutes of Health that compares the three authorized vaccines in the US got a big jump in immunity from a booster shot, starting about 15 days after it was given.

However, some people might want to use a different vaccine type. For example, a younger man who initially got a Moderna vaccine might seek Johnson and Johnson's vaccine for the boost, because mRNA vaccines like Pfizer's and Moderna's are linked with a slight risk of a heart inflammation called myocarditis, while J&J's isn't. Men under 40 are at higher risk of myocarditis. And a woman under 50 might prefer to get an mRNA vaccine for her booster shot, because the J&J vaccine is linked with a slightly higher risk of a rare blood clotting condition that is more likely to affect younger women.

The US travel ban is lifted as cases in Europe surge

The United States reopened its borders to fully vaccinated international travelers on Monday, ending a 20-month travel ban on people entering from 33 countries, which include the UK and much of Europe.

But beyond the joyous scenes unfolding across American airports lies a dark backdrop, Sheena McKenzie writes

Europe is in the grip of its fifth wave of the pandemic and large swathes of the continent are battling to beat back surges of the Delta variant, amid the relaxation of restrictions and stuttering vaccine rollouts in some countries. WHO has warned that a half a million Europeans could die with Covid-19 in a potentially devastating winter, leading some to question if the US will be importing more of the virus as packed transatlantic flights land on American soil.

What the end of the pandemic could look like

It's highly unlikely that the United States, let alone the world, can eliminate the virus that causes Covid-19, Jacqueline Howard writes

But there will come a day when it's no longer a pandemic, when cases are no longer out of control and hospitals aren't at great risk of overflowing with patients. Many experts predict the spread of coronavirus will look and feel more like seasonal influenza. What's less clear is how and when that will happen. Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, told the US Senate in a hearing on Thursday that ""what we hope to get it at is such a low level that even though it isn't completely eliminated, it doesn't have a major impact on public health or on the way we run our lives."" Fauci said that if more people around the world get vaccinated quicker, ""hopefully within a reasonable period of time we will get to that point where it might occasionally be up and down in the background but it won't dominate us the way it's doing right now.""

But to transition from pandemic to endemic, populations need to build up immunity to the coronavirus. And with vaccine hesitancy persisting and populations refusing to wear masks, that transition could take time.

Unvaccinated man apologizes to medical staff who saved his life

After battling Covid for almost a month and being released from a Seattle hospital, Richard Soliz returned in late October. But this time it wasn't for another treatment -- it was to apologize, Noah Sheidlower and Christina Zdanowicz write

Soliz, a graphic artist who had not gotten vaccinated, spent 28 days on a ventilator and heart monitor in hospital in late August and much of September. He is now fully inoculated, and is encouraging people to get the vaccine -- not just because of what he went through, but because of the ""tremendous burden"" on medical staff, many of whom work 12-hour shifts and have received little time off.

""I am certain that there is truth to this virus, and not being vaccinated leaves you vulnerable to the extent of possibly really taking a person's life,"" Soliz said. ""I personally know that, because I was not vaccinated. I did not act, I wasn't certain, and I nearly lost my life,"" he said.

TODAY'S TOP TIP

While the US lifted its travel ban this week, strict rules for entering the country still apply. Here's what you need to know before flying:

Getting vaccinated is a key requirement for most international travelers hoping to enter. Children under 18 are exempt.

Air travelers aged 2 and up also need to provide proof of a negative Covid-19 test, regardless of nationality. Passengers are required to test negative for Covid-19 within three days of their flight's departure.

cnn,CNN,Opinion by Tim Spector,Long Covid is real. But there are ways to protect yourself,"More research needs to be done to help understand long Covid, but while we wait for the research to catch up, the easiest way to reduce the likelihood of getting long Covid is to get fully vaccinated as soon as possible, writes Tim Spector.",https://www.cnn.com/2021/11/05/opinions/ways-to-protect-yourself-long-covid-spector/index.html,2021-11-05T15:10:25Z,"Tim Spector is a professor of genetic epidemiology at King's College London, scientific co-founder of ZOE, a health science company, senior researcher of the PREDICT study, and lead scientist of the … [+5534 chars]",Left,"Tim Spector is a professor of genetic epidemiology at King's College London, scientific co-founder of ZOE, a health science company, senior researcher of the PREDICT study, and lead scientist of the ZOE COVID Study. The views expressed in this commentary are his own. View more opinion at CNN.

(CNN) At the start of the pandemic, as Covid-19 spread across the world, more and more reports appeared of people suffering from symptoms for weeks and often months after their initial diagnosis. Due to lack of testing and, more importantly, lack of understanding of this new virus, these long-term sufferers were left with no answers and no hope. Many people were turned away by medical professionals and their persistent and odd symptoms were blamed on anxiety . But what was really going on?

What we know about long Covid and vaccines

In early 2020, ZOE , the health science company that I cofounded, was preparing to launch a new nutritional health program. But then, when the pandemic hit, the ZOE team felt compelled to help address the immediate health challenges before us. We responded by using our existing technology to build and launch an app to collect Covid symptoms in real-time. The ZOE COVID Study now has more than 4.5 million contributors across the UK, the US, and Sweden -- and it has allowed us to learn more about long Covid and understand what needs to be done to reduce the risk of contracting it.

The ZOE app started tracking vaccines in the UK as soon as they were rolled out in December 2020 and since then, we've been investigating the link between vaccination and long Covid and have gathered some interesting findings.

According to our research, published in ""Nature,"" around one in 20 unvaccinated people who are symptomatic with Covid-19 experience symptoms for at least eight weeks, and around one in 50 experience symptoms for three months or more.

However, for vaccinated individuals, our analysis, published in ""Lancet Infectious Diseases,"" found that double vaccinated (AstraZeneca or Pfizer) adults were 49% less likely to get long Covid should they get infected. In short, their chances of developing long Covid were cut by half.

The analysis also found that those who contracted Covid-19 after two doses were 74% less likely to be hospitalized and 35% less likely to experience acute Covid symptoms. When it comes to long Covid prevention, vaccination seems to be key.

Right now, according to the ZOE data , the UK is seeing the highest Covid rates we've had in 2021. While the risk of getting long Covid when vaccinated is very small, ultimately, it's a numbers game. More cases means more people who may go on to experience long Covid. But anyone who wants to limit their chances of long Covid should get vaccinated and take precautionary measures, like wearing a mask, to avoid contracting the virus.

What about those who are already suffering from long Covid?

It wasn't until this October that the World Health Organization finally recognized long Covid as "" post Covid-19 condition ."" By providing a definition, it not only signals to medical professionals to take long Covid seriously but also offers some form of vindication for those who continue to deal with long Covid symptoms.

And fortunately there are more data that show promise for long Covid sufferers, A patient-led group called LongCovidSOS found t hat of the over 800 long Covid patients surveyed, more than half reported an overall improvement in their symptoms post-vaccination. This study has only been released as a preprint so it has yet to be reviewed by other scientists, but the findings are encouraging.

While it appears that Covid-19 vaccines can have a positive impact on long Covid sufferers, it's not clear why. Perhaps the immune response triggered by the vaccines has a direct impact on symptoms. It could be that certain types of long Covid respond well to vaccines or that certain types of vaccines are effective against long Covid. Or maybe the vaccines alleviate symptoms for people who have less complicated conditions. In order to know which, if any, of these ideas is correct, more research needs to be done. The plus is that getting vaccinated certainly doesn't seem to make long Covid worse.

In fact, we've even heard anecdotal reports of symptoms improving and life getting easier for long Covid sufferers after being vaccinated. There are research studies happening all over the world and I would encourage anyone who is coping with long Covid to look up a nearby long Covid study and get involved.

It's becoming clearer that we'll all be living in a Covid-19 reality for some time to come. We must continue to take steps that will keep cases low so that globally, we can limit the number of people who will have to live with Covid's long-term, life-limiting symptoms. Get vaccinated. Follow up with a booster shot. Continue to practice social distancing in busy spaces. Wash your hands. And, while I know wearing a mask can be uncomfortable or annoying, it's one of the most effective steps we can take as a society to prevent the spread of this virus. So, please keep wearing your mask."

Now, the financial fallout might follow workers beyond the grave. If they die of covid and weren't vaccinated, their families may not get death benefits they would otherwise have received.

New York's Metropolitan Transportation Authority no longer pays a $500,000 death benefit to the families of subway, bus and commuter rail workers who die of covid if the workers were unvaccinated at the time of death.

""It strikes me as needlessly cruel,"" said Mark DeBofsky, a lawyer at DeBofsky Sherman Casciari Reynolds in Chicago who represents workers in benefit disputes.

Other employers have similar concerns about providing death or other benefits to employees who refuse to be vaccinated.

In Massachusetts, the New Bedford City Council sought to extend accidental death benefits to city employees who died of covid, but the mayor didn't sign that legislation because, among other things, it didn't prohibit payment if the worker was unvaccinated.

President Joe Biden has leaned hard on businesses to make sure their workers are vaccinated. In September, the administration announced all employers with 100 or more workers would be required to either ensure they're vaccinated or test employees every week for covid.

Among employers, ""there's a frustration level, particularly at this point when these vaccines are fully approved,"" said Carol Harnett, president of the Council for Disability Awareness, an industry group. ""You're trying to protect yourselves and your employees, both from themselves and the general public.""

The New York transportation authority is the highest-profile employer to take this action. Since the pandemic crisis began in 2020, 173 MTA workers have contracted covid and died. Five of those deaths occurred after June 1 of this year, when the policy changed, according to the MTA.

""We are not aware they have been vaccinated,"" an MTA spokesperson said of the five workers who died since the policy took effect.

The transit authority's policy was a shift from an earlier pact with workers. In April 2020, as covid ravaged New York, transit officials and the labor unions representing employees reached agreements that workers who died of covid would be eligible to receive a $500,000 lump-sum death benefit , just like payments to which families of MTA workers who have other job-related deaths are entitled. The program will continue through the end of this year.

But with covid vaccines now widely available and fully approved by the Food and Drug Administration, the MTA Board determined that, starting June 1, workers who died of covid had to have been vaccinated for their families to be eligible for the payment.

The change comes as the MTA has struggled to improve vaccination rates among its roughly 67,000 workers. More than 70% of transit employees are estimated to be vaccinated, according to MTA officials.

A spokesperson for the MTA stressed that the program remains in effect, and noted that it has been extended past its original one-year term. The only change is the vaccination requirement.

""The program is not being revoked,"" the MTA spokesperson said in an email. ""In fact, the MTA has twice extended it.""

Local 100 of the Transport Workers Union, which represents roughly 38,000 MTA workers, pushed hard to negotiate the benefit. ""No other workforce in the city, probably the country, secured what TWU secured: a $500,000 payment from the employer to the families of workers who died after getting covid,"" said Pete Donohue, a union spokesperson. ""We look at it that during a terrible time, we got [the benefit] for people.""

It's not unusual for employers of workers in risky occupations — such as police, firefighters, utility company workers and transit workers, who could succumb to an industrial accident or get hit by a train on the tracks — to offer extra insurance coverage that pays if they die on the job. The coverage is often provided in addition to a regular life insurance policy.

These so-called line-of-duty or accidental death and dismemberment policies typically don't pay out if someone dies of a disease. How can it be proved that someone picked up a deadly infection at work rather than at the supermarket?

But with covid, some front-line workers have been considered eligible for accidental death benefits because they are presumed to have gotten sick on the job , DeBofsky said.

Workers may be denied death benefits, however, if they didn't follow established safety protocols, said John Ehrlich, the national lead consultant at Willis Towers Watson on group life insurance. Failing to wear a bulletproof vest, a helmet or other safety equipment, for example, might make their families ineligible for payment under a policy.

Now that vaccines are widely available, some employers have considered limiting other benefits paid to unvaccinated workers, including reducing short-term disability payments, said Rich Fuerstenberg, a senior partner at benefits consultant Mercer. But Fuerstenberg said he had not heard of other employers eliminating death benefits for unvaccinated workers.

In the New Bedford case, the City Council unanimously passed a petition in August stating the covid death of any city employee would be considered to have occurred in the line of duty, enabling family members to receive accidental death benefits.

Mayor Jon Mitchell, however, objected for several reasons — the question of vaccination among them.

""As I am certain the Council would agree, it would be inappropriate to extend accidental death benefits where the employee refused to take a vaccine that had been found to be nearly 100% effective,"" Mitchell said in a letter to the council. The proposal has been tabled for further negotiation, according to a spokesperson for the mayor.

For more than 17 years, Joseph Fletcher worked for the MTA in Brooklyn, doing body work and other maintenance on buses.

When he died of covid on April 11, 2020, at age 60, he left behind his wife, Veronica, a former high school teacher who was disabled after a car accident, and three children, now 9, 13 and 16.

Coping with his death was hard enough, but looking toward the future has been overwhelming, Veronica said.

""How am I going to keep afloat financially?"" she worried. ""Everything about this journey is terrifying.""

The $500,000 death benefit helped cover the family's regular bills and pay the mortgage on their Brooklyn home. But she's aware it will go only so far, and her three children need to go to college.

If the MTA vaccination requirement had been in place when her husband died, it wouldn't have been a problem, Fletcher said.

""I showed him the picture, and he read the box, and I think his eyes went straight to the 5- to 11-year-old (label),"" his mom Brandy Wittenborn said.

""He said, 'Wait -- wait, that's for us?' We said 'yes, it is.' And he's like, 'You mean, we're going to get the shot soon?' I said 'yes, you will.' So he's very excited.""

Across the country, many parents and even children are celebrating the news that kids ages 5 to 11 can now get vaccinated against Covid-19

For Nate and his 11-year-old brother, the vaccine means sleepovers and a long-delayed vacation to Disneyland.

For a family in South Carolina, the shots mean a 10-year-old cancer survivor can finally go back to school after 17 months at home.

And to a family in California, the child vaccine is critical to help prevent new variants and end this pandemic for everyone.

Indiana parents want to protect the vulnerable patients they work with

Brandy Wittenborn, with her sons Derek, Nate and Will, said every doctor she spoke with recommended the vaccine.

Brandy Wittenborn didn't initially think she would ever need to vaccinate her three sons -- Derek, now 11; Nate, now 8; and Will, now 4.

""When they were developing this vaccine, I honestly thought that we wouldn't have to vaccinate our kids that are maybe under 10, if they weren't affected as much, and weren't a part of as much of the spread of the virus,"" said the dental hygienist from Carmel, Indiana.

""But as we rolled out the vaccine for adults, and you saw so much vaccine hesitancy, it kind of occurred to me: If we are going to reach any kind of herd immunity, it's going to have to involve the under-10 crowd ... and that was really before we started seeing some of these variants that affected kids a little bit more,"" Wittenborn said.

""So when they started studying the vaccine in the 12-and-up crowd, the mRNA science seems extremely safe when compared to some of the other vaccines that we've had developed in history. I couldn't really see that the risks were going to be any more for that younger crowd than for adults.""

Wittenborn dug deep into the research and paid close attention to why advisers to the US Food and Drug Administration recommended the vaccine for 5- to 11-year-olds.

""I listened to the whole FDA advisory meeting last week,"" she said. ""I myself am a dental hygienist. My husband is a nephrologist -- a kidney specialist. We have a large handful of physician friends around the area that we've listened to. ... When you see that over and over and over again, with trusted pediatricians, you think, well, this is what they're doing with their own child. So this is what we should do with ours.""

She said it's especially important to vaccinate her sons because of the vulnerable people both parents work with.

""I work at a pediatric dental office. I have a lot of kids that have underlying medical conditions. A lot of special needs patients that can't wear a mask. My husband, being a nephrologist, has patients with kidney disease, patients that require dialysis. And these patients that he sees are not healthy, have several underlying conditions,"" Wittenborn said.

""So we've had to live with almost two years of: What if one of the kids brings Covid home from school, passes it along to my husband and I, even though he and I've been vaccinated for a while, if we do have a mild breakthrough case that we don't realize we're sick with, and he takes it into the dialysis center, into the hospital, or into the ICU?""

""So for us, the benefit of getting those boys vaccinated kind of cuts down on the risk of us carrying that infection to somebody that would have more severe disease than one of us would.""

She did ask the family's pediatrician about myocarditis, an inflammation of the heart muscle that has appeared occasionally in younger men after a second dose of Covid-19 vaccine.

She learned that post-vaccine myocarditis is rare, and those who do get it often have mild, treatable cases -- unlike some who get severe myocarditis due to Covid-19.

""I have talked to our pediatrician ... if you have a myocarditis incident after a viral infection, those can be fatal, lead to hospitalizations, more severe disease,"" Wittenborn said, matching what other pediatricians have said

She said her 8- and 11-year-old sons are excited to get vaccinated.

""To them, it means that they may not have to wear a mask indoors anymore. Neither of the boys have ever had sleepovers with their friends. This will make sleepovers easier to have. The boys will know that their grandparents will be a little safer being around them more frequently, or maybe they'll go be able to go spend some time staying with their grandparents more.""

And soon, the family will finally get to go to Disneyland.

""We had a Disneyland vacation booked for April of 2020 that we had to cancel because of the pandemic,"" Wittenborn said. ""They are definitely excited.""

A young cancer survivor wants to go back to school

Jodie Srutek's 10-year-old daughter hasn't been inside a classroom in 1 1/2 years.

She's a cancer survivor who's at high risk for severe Covid-19 if she gets infected, Srutek said. But her school doesn't require masks, and the risk of going to school unvaccinated is too high, said the mom from Bluffton, South Carolina.

""As soon as we can get the vaccine, we will get it,"" Srutek said shortly before her daughter became eligible Tuesday. ""Even if it means we have to drive two hours away to get it ... we will do that if we have to.""

But she's already discovered problems with access. Her pediatrician's office said it didn't have a freezer cold enough to store the Pfizer vaccine, which must be kept at a colder temperature than the Moderna vaccine used for adults in the area, Srutek said.

She learned a local superstore was planning to give pediatric Covid-19 vaccines. But a crowded store would be unsafe for Srutek's 10-year-old, who did not want to be named for this story.

Even though the girl's kidney cancer is in remission, ""she still has residual health effects from her treatment,"" Srutek said.

While some parents have expressed concern about possible long-term side effects after vaccination, ""we're definitely more concerned about long-term effects of Covid,"" Srutek said.

""I don't know of any vaccines that have long-term effects for most folks -- it's usually pretty quick if there's an adverse reaction,"" Srutek said, echoing what doctors have said about the unlikelihood of long-term vaccine side effects.

To her daughter, the vaccine is ""a ticket back to normal"" -- including birthday parties and a return to in-person learning for the first time since March 2020.

""I want to get it so much so I can go to school and see my friends!"" the 10-year-old said.

""I'll be able to go to the park even if there are a lot of other people there. And I'll be able to go to Disney World and Universal again.""

Vaccinating kids will help prevent new variants, a scientist and mom says

Alicia Zhou, with her husband Jose Medina and their son Davi, said the entire family is excited to get Davi vaccinated soon.

Alicia Zhou didn't just read reports about Covid-19 vaccines. She insisted on reviewing all the primary data before vaccinating her 6-year-old son, Davi.

""I didn't just take anybody's word for it,"" said Zhou, the chief science officer at Color , a company specializing in public health infrastructure.

""I looked at the clinical trial evidence and I evaluated it. And honestly, it's some of the most impressive data ... that I've seen when it comes to vaccination,"" the molecular biologist said.

JUST WATCHED Pfizer says its smaller dose for kids is nearly 91% effective in preventing symptomatic Covid-19 Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Pfizer says its smaller dose for kids is nearly 91% effective in preventing symptomatic Covid-19 02:47

""I could see how if you're just reading it from a press release, or you're just reading from a news article, you might feel like it's exaggerated or might be a rosy version of the truth. But having gone to the primary data myself, it's very, very compelling.""

So as a scientist and as a mother, ""it feels like a no-brainer to have my child be vaccinated.""

While children are generally at lower risk of severe illness from Covid-19, pediatricians say they can still be at risk of long-term complications -- regardless of how minor their initial symptoms may have been.

While the odds of severe Covid-19 among kids may seem low, Zhou said she doesn't want to take the chance.

""If I give you a bag of 1,000 M&Ms, and said only one of them will kill you, would you let your kid eat one?""

But Davi's vaccine won't just benefit himself, his mom said.

""When we think about: Why is the pandemic dragging on? Where are these new variants coming from? And how is that causing us to have a prolongment of this pandemic? The reality is that the virus evolves and changes and adapts,"" Zhou said.

""And as long as you continue to have pools of unvaccinated and susceptible individuals, it is giving more opportunity for the virus to continue to replicate and evolve and change. And so our best protection against more novel variants developing that could become even more advantageous than even Delta is to increase the amount of vaccination within the population or immunity within the population -- either by getting Covid-19 or by being vaccinated.""

An Ohio family knows how rough Covid-19 can be

Ava Middendorf, in the red jacket, suffered tremors for 12 weeks after her Covid-19 diagnosis last year, her mom said.

Even before a vaccine was available to 11-year-old Ava Middendorf, her mom Jennifer had already booked an appointment.

Ava and both her parents came down with Covid-19 in the summer of 2020, before vaccines were publicly available to anyone.

""My husband started with it. And then I got it, and my youngest daughter got it. And for her, her symptoms were relatively mild,"" said the mom from Plain City, Ohio.

""But there was this strange tremor that appeared. Her whole right side, her arm and hand shook. And I never would have attributed that to Covid.""

A pediatrician referred the family to a neurologist, and ""he said, 'You know, you can never prove these things. But ... the onset of it, and the way that it's acting, it was likely a virally induced tremor.' And as she shed the virus, as he predicted, those tremors went away -- but not for 12 weeks,"" Jennifer said.

Her husband Andy was ""really, really sick"" during his bout of Covid-19.

And the possibility of Covid-19 reinfection is real -- especially for those unvaccinated.

""I think for us, we just wanted some degree of normalcy back and wanted to be able to take that into our own hands,"" Jennifer Middendorf said. ""So we had no hesitation about getting vaccinated.""

Her older daughter, 14-year-old Abby, got vaccinated the first day she became eligible. Ava, 11, has an appointment to get her first shot next week.

""They both have been very pro-vaccination,"" Jennifer said. ""They want to be able to play sports. They want to be able to be out. And they don't want to get sick.""

Correction: An earlier version of this story incorrectly spelled the last name of the Middendorf family."

Even with 58.5% percent of Americans fully vaccinated and mandatory vaccines for federal employees and contractors set to go into effect, anti-vaccine misinformation is still commonplace.

From dead giraffes to baseless allegations of fraud against a vaccine manufacturer's CEO, here are the facts behind a few of the recent claims that have been circulating.

Colorado hospitals

After Colorado Gov. Jared Polis issued an executive order on October 31 allowing hospitals at capacity or ""reasonably anticipated to reach capacity"" to divert patients to different facilities or stop admitting new patients, some on social media have claimed his executive order allows hospitals to refuse treatment to individuals who have not received a Covid-19 vaccine.

""Colorado Governor mandates that hospitals do NOT have to treat the unvaccinated,"" one tweet declared

Facts First: This is false. The governor's executive order does not mention vaccination status as a criterion for admitting patients.

While it's possible some of those impacted by the order may be unvaccinated, the order does not target those individuals specifically. Its goal is to ease the burden on hospitals and ""respond to the current rise in cases due to COVID-19 in Colorado.""

According to the latest data from Colorado's health department, 93% of the state's acute care hospital beds were in use and 80% of those currently hospitalized are unvaccinated.

The CEO of Pfizer

Last week, a conservative website published an article claiming that Albert Bourla, the CEO of pharmaceutical company Pfizer, which has manufactured one of the Covid-19 vaccines approved for use in the US, was arrested and charged with fraud ""for his role in deceiving customers on the effectiveness of the COVID-19 'vaccine.'""

The site, which purports to present ""news stories of interest to Proud Canadians,"" based the article and its claim on what it said was the word of an unnamed FBI agent.

Facts First: This is blatantly false.

In an email to CNN, Pfizer confirmed the claim was false, and the FBI told the AP that it did not have any information on the allegations.

""This claim is false, Dr. Bourla has not been arrested,"" Pfizer media relations told CNN. ""Additionally, he also had on air interviews with CNN the day of the false allegation.""

A search in the Federal Bureau of Prisons database revealed no inmate by the name of Albert Bourla.

A video of the Vice President

One clip circulating on social media purports to show Vice President Kamala Harris saying that virtually every individual hospitalized with Covid-19 is vaccinated.

In the video, Harris appears to say, ""Virtually every person who is in the hospital, sick with Covid-19 right now, is vaccinated. I'm going to repeat that. It's a fact. Virtually every person who is in the hospital right now, sick with Covid-19 is vaccinated. And even more regrettably virtually every person who has recently died from Covid-19 was vaccinated. The loss. The tragedy of that loss. Literally every person who has died from Covid-19 that we have recently been seeing was vaccinated.""

Facts First: This is false. The video was edited to make it appear Harris said the opposite of what she really said.

video from the White House shows that at a vaccine mobilization event in July, Harris actually said, ""Virtually every person who is in the hospital, sick with Covid-19 right now, is unvaccinated. I'm going to repeat that. It's a fact. Virtually every person who is in the hospital right now, sick with Covid-19 is unvaccinated. And even more regrettably, virtually everyone who has recently died from Covid-19 was unvaccinated. The loss. The tragedy of that loss. Literally every person who has died from Covid-19 that we have recently been seeing was unvaccinated.""

In addition to this evidence of her actual remarks from a verified source, there are signs within the video suggesting it's been distorted. At the start of the altered video, Harris actually touts the benefits of the vaccine, saying ""the vaccine will protect you."" And before she repeats the false claim a second time, the video seems to skip to a section of video mid-applause.

Reuters was first to report that the video was altered and the audio edited.

Travis Scott concert

As the investigation continues into the deaths of several attendees at Travis Scott's concert during the Astroworld music festival in Houston, there's been a spate of false claims suggesting vaccines were responsible for the fatal crowd surge.

One Facebook post implied the magnetic frequencies in the music compelled the concert-goers to stampede toward the stage because the post claims there is graphene oxide in their system as a result of the Covid-19 vaccine.

The post was flagged as part of Facebook's efforts to combat misinformation in partnership with PolitiFact.

Facts First: This is false. Graphene oxide is not included in the This is false. Graphene oxide is not included in the ingredient lists of any of the Covid-19 vaccines authorized for use in the US.

Ron Mertens, founder and CEO of Graphene-Info.com, a graphene news website, told PolitiFact that graphene oxide is ""not magnetic and not a conductive material, so it cannot be used in the ways people suggest in such videos.""

Graphene oxide has several biomedical applications and at least one study suggests it could be effective in some vaccines. However, a Pfizer spokesperson told PolitiFact it is not used at Pfizer.

Dallas Zoo giraffes

Several social media posts, including one from an influential QAnon supporter, have suggested the deaths of three giraffes at the Dallas Zoo within the span of one month were caused by the Covid-19 vaccine.

As evidence, the posts include screenshots noting that the zoo had plans to vaccinate animals and that experts were investigating whether two of the giraffe deaths were connected, Newsweek reported

Facts First: None of the giraffes were vaccinated and they died of a variety of other causes.

On October 3, the zoo euthanized a three-month old giraffe calf after she was injured. Auggie, a 19-year-old giraffe, died October 22 ""after dealing with age-related health issues that led to liver failure,"" the zoo said . According to the zoo, results from a blood test showed the third giraffe, a 14-year-old male named Jesse who died on October 29, had ""abnormal liver enzymes.""

In a statement provided to CNN, zoo officials said they were investigating whether the last two deaths were connected but as of early November had yet to establish definitive proof.

Though the zoo did announce plans to begin vaccinating some of its animals, they had not done so when the giraffes died."

(CNN) So, guys, who wants to be a superhero? That was the question I asked my two sons about getting vaccinated against Covid-19.

On November 3, the rollout of the Covid-19 vaccine for children ages 5 to 11 started -- a significant milestone in our fight to end the pandemic. The White House estimates nearly 1 million children in this age group have already received their first shot of the two-dose Pfizer series and another 700,000 appointments are scheduled in the ""coming days,"" including for my two boys, Ammar and Hasan.

I recently wrote about why I'm going to vaccinate my kids , sharing three specific reasons. One: for their protection. By being vaccinated, they will have a reduced risk of suffering from severe illness, hospitalization, death or experiencing Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children (MIS-C). Two: for our collective societal protection. We can't truly end this pandemic until we have more immunity in the population, and children play a big role in that community immunity. And, three: to resume the pre-pandemic activities we enjoyed doing as a family.

While my entire family, including my children, were infected with the virus that causes Covid-19 in April 2020, my kids' immune protection might not be strong enough now to ward off re-infection, or be as durable or reliable as vaccine-induced immunity.

My eldest son, Ammar, is 8 years old and is in third grade. He's a bit more risk-tolerant than my younger son, Hasan, who is 5 years old and in kindergarten. Hasan, when given the opportunity, can talk an earful about Covid-19 and the intricacies of the immune system. His explanation of how the body fights the virus and generates antibodies is one of the most adorable conversations I've ever had with him. They're both great kids who have been fascinated by the Marvel superhero universe. Guests who come to our home usually get a whole costume parade by the boys who dress up and pretend to fight off the bad guys.

So much has been and will be said about vaccinating kids against Covid-19. I talk to family, friends, community members, colleagues and patients about it, and I've written about it. But this is about kids -- so talking to my kids about getting vaccinated and allowing them to share their thoughts is also an important part of the process. In preparation for Ammar and Hasan's Covid-19 vaccine appointment, I sat down with them to discuss the vaccine and how they feel about getting vaccinated.

The following interview has been lightly edited for clarity.

Mom: So, guys, who wants to be a superhero?

Ammar: Me! I want to be Iron Man and Captain America!

Hasan: And I want to be Black Panther and Spider-Man!

Mom: Did you know that by getting vaccinated against the Covid-19 virus, you're acting like a superhero? The vaccine not only helps protect you against the virus and keeps you protected, but it also helps make sure you don't spread the virus to other people and get them sick. Just like superheroes, you will be helping other people by also protecting them.

Hasan: Wow! In my school, my teacher is vaccinated and she's also helping stop the virus from spreading. And so my friends are safe too because she's vaccinated.

Mom: That's right, Hasan. Do you want to be just like your teacher and help protect yourself and your friends, too?

Hasan: Yes, because at recess there are a lot of kids playing together and I want to be more protected.

Mom: Do guys know if any of your friends in school have been vaccinated against Covid-19 yet and are kids talking about the vaccine?

Ammar: One of my friends said he's going to get the vaccine. I'm going to tell him congratulations when I see him again.

Hasan: No, I don't know any friend in school who said they got the vaccine but maybe they don't know it's available so I will tell them it's available now and that I will get the vaccine.

Mom: Mommy and Daddy are vaccinated against the Covid-19 virus, what do you think about that?

Ammar: I'm happy because you are protected from the virus. I don't want you to get sick. I don't want you to die.

Mom: Do you want to be protected too?

Ammar: Yes. I want to get the vaccine as soon as possible. Can we go tomorrow?

Mom: No, we have our appointment next week. Since you have a runny nose and cough, we have to wait until you feel better.

Ammar, you were just tested for Covid-19 because you weren't feeling well, and we wanted to make sure you didn't have the virus before going back to school. How did you feel when you were getting tested at the doctor's office?

Ammar: I didn't like it all. I didn't like the stick (swab) the doctor put in my nose. I don't want to do it again.

Mom: Well, you know another benefit of getting vaccinated against Covid-19 is that you have a smaller chance of getting the virus so you wouldn't have to get tested as often.

So, guys, when you get the Covid-19 vaccine what are you most excited about

Hasan: being a superhero!

Mom: What do you want to do after you're vaccinated, since we can then do more activities safely like going to the movies, traveling to other places by airplane, seeing more friends and family and having play dates?

Ammar: I want to travel to Texas because I was born there.

Hasan: I don't want to wear my mask anymore after I'm vaccinated.

Mom: When you're vaccinated, you're more protected from the virus so you don't have to wear a mask in many places like when we're around other people who are also vaccinated -- but we're going to have to keep our masks on a little while longer when we're in school or inside a building where there's a lot of people.

Ammar, I know you're afraid of needles. What do you want to tell other kids to help prepare them for their Covid-19 vaccine like mommy taught you when you go for your flu shot every year?

Ammar: the needle is pointy but it's only two seconds -- it's like a pinch for two seconds and then you get the protection so it will be OK. Just think about something you want to play with when you get home, so you don't think about the shot.

Hasan: Don't be scared, it's just a shot. Shots are not scary, they protect people. And the doctor says good job and gives you a sticker or a candy after.

***

Hearing my boys' excitement at protecting themselves and others makes me so proud. And once they are fully vaccinated, I will breathe a huge sigh of relief knowing that they are that much safer. In the meantime, I am continuing to prepare them for their appointment. These small tips , based in part on CDC advice and a guide that I helped to create for the Harvard Kennedy School's Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs, can help keep kids safe and stress-free when they get their Covid-19 vaccine.

• Ahead of your kids' appointments, continue to practice Covid-safe behavior such as wearing a mask and watching your distance at the vaccine appointment.

• Keep kids hydrated and give them a snack before their vaccine appointments. This can help if they feel nervous, get dizzy or lightheaded.

• Dress the kids in loose, comfortable clothing. This will enable them to easily expose the arm.

• Give a pep talk on what to expect, just like any other vaccine appointment.

• Wait the recommended 15-30 minutes post-injection at the clinic to monitor for possible allergic reactions or serious side effects.

• Be prepared for common side effects after their vaccination including soreness in their arm, feeling tired or achy, having a headache, or getting a fever. Side effects usually resolve after one to two days.

• Enroll in V-SAFE . It's a free tool that provides personalized health check-in after receiving a Covid-19 vaccine, a reminder to get a second dose, and to report any side effects children may experience to the CDC.

• Continue to practice Covid-safe behavior. It takes time for the body to build protection after any vaccination. Kids are considered fully vaccinated two weeks after administration of their second Covid-19 dose."

US Surgeon General Dr. Vivek Murthy said during the Citizen by CNN event Thursday that having an available Covid-19 vaccine for children ages 5 and older gives parents the opportunity to protect their children “at long last” – but now they must guard against misinformation around the vaccine.

Murthy said he wants to make sure that people have access to the facts, and that one of his great worries is that parents have already faced a large wave of misinformation -- and this could increase in the days ahead, now that a vaccine is available.

“We have to guard against that misinformation,” Murthy told CNN Chief Medical Correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta. “I want parents to know that their questions are important but it’s important that they also go to credible sources to get answers to those questions, like their doctor, their children’s hospital, their local department of health or the CDC.”

Children who are immunocompromised, have other medical conditions or whose exposure risk is significantly higher may have the greatest urgency to be vaccinated, he said.

“But I think what we’ve seen over the past year and a half is that of the millions of kids who have been infected with Covid under 18, millions of those have actually had no underlying medical conditions,” he said. “So while we do know that having other medical conditions, being immunocompromised, puts you at greater risk, there are still significant risks to kids who are perfectly healthy.”

He described conversations that he and others had with parents of perfectly healthy children who got seriously ill with Covid-19 as “some of the greatest tragedies.”

Murthy described when his own daughter went to the emergency room with an illness a few years ago, saying “I don’t want any parent to have to go through that and so even though our kids do much better than adults when it comes to Covid, we’ve lost too many of them. We’ve had too many hospitalized. And that’s why I want every child to have protection from this virus. The vaccine gives us the opportunity to protect them at long last, and that’s why I’m hopeful that parents will strongly consider that option.""

“As parents, if we can take a low risk to our kids and make it even lower, if we can secure their future and their health, you know, even more strongly, you know, with the aid of something like a vaccine, I think a lot of people want to do that,"" he continued."

(CNN) The Covid-19 pandemic recently passed two very different milestones: More than half of the world has received at least one vaccine against the infection while at the same time, the 5 millionth person has died of the disease. The persistence of large swaths of the unvaccinated people despite ample vaccine supplies here in the US continues to frustrate public health experts, resulting in an array of strategies to sway the vaccine-hesitant.

At the same time, those who are fully vaccinated and qualify for a booster dose are providing us with a clearer understanding of the central questions surrounding the booster: who and when and with which vaccine? The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention currently recommends a booster for those 65 and older, as well as those 50 to 64 with preexisting health/medical conditions that place them at higher risk for severe disease. Additional groups with occupational and other risk factors, and anyone over 18 who got the single-dose J&J vaccine at least two months ago also qualify.

But an article published last week in The Lancet could very well result in an expansion of the current guidance. In the study, Israeli researchers demonstrated the benefits of a vaccine ""boost"" for recipients of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine -- a third shot given at least five months after completion of the two-dose series.

Investigators used data from a health organization caring for more than half of the Israeli population, splitting over 1.4 million participants into two groups: one that had received the third shot, and a demographically and medically identical group that had not. Each group was then followed for up to two months after the booster (and for an equivalent time in the unboosted).

The results are startling: Compared to those who did not receive a third shot, the booster decreased the rate of hospitalization, severe disease and death from Covid-19 by about 80% to over 90%, no matter the person's sex, number of other underlying medical conditions, or age if over 40 years. (The analysis lumped people into three age groups: 16 to 39 years; 40 to 69 years; and older than 69 years. Comparable reduction in infection rate was seen in the middle and older groups but cases were too infrequent in those under 40 years old to draw a firm conclusion).

Although only conjecture, this would seem to demonstrate that waning -- and boostable -- immunity is indeed responsible for serious and even fatal new cases in a well-vaccinated individual.

Many of these reports have been met with some hesitancy by many public health experts and scientists . The concerns are well-founded: Using one small country and only one brand of vaccine does indeed create uncertainty about generalizability of any findings. Plus, much of the research has not used a randomized placebo-controlled format -- the sine qua non of clinical investigation. A placebo-controlled trial, though, would require dummy shots to be given and would take months and months -- precious time given the world's difficulties containing the virus.

This loud public disagreement led to a radical redesign in how best to determine whether a new drug or vaccine works. It wasn't easy: Balancing the need to obtain reliable results as quickly as possible and the humanitarian pressures of a global catastrophe is nearly impossible. But nowhere is the benefit of decades of clinical trials improvement more evident than in the world's response to Covid-19. Practicality, it turns out, is as crucial as statistical significance.

So, for now, despite some concerns about methods, the best data on the usefulness of boosting is this new study from Israel. It may turn out to underestimate or overestimate the benefits of the booster shot but in its real-world study assumptions, it mimics the real world we live in -- one where no decision, medical or otherwise, ever is made with complete information or certainty. Given this latest data, the CDC should revise its recommendation for everyone age 40 and older and tell them to roll up their sleeve for yet another shot. It will save lives."

Despite a century of advancements in treatment, education and prevention, World Diabetes Day 2021 occurs in the wakeof grim statistics. One in 10 adults around the world -- some 537 million people -- are currently living with diabetes, according to figures recently released by the International Diabetes Federation (IDF).

By 2024, the IDF predicted that the number of people with diabetes is expected to rise to 1 in 8 adults.

""As the world marks the centenary of the discovery of insulin, I wish we could say we've stopped the rising tide of diabetes,"" IDF President Dr. Andrew Boulton told CNN. ""Instead, diabetes is currently a pandemic of unprecedented magnitude.""

Nearly 7 million adults have died worldwide in 2021 so far due to diabetes or its complications, the IDF estimated -- that's more than 1 in 10 global deaths from any cause.

That doesn't count the lives lost to the novel coronavirus, which has been particularly deadly for people living with diabetes. A study published in February found having either Type 1 or Type 2 diabetes tripled the risk of severe illness and death from Covid-19.

""And if you want another startling statistic, as many as 40% of the people that have died in the US from Covid-19 had diabetes,"" said Dr. Robert Gabbay, chief scientific and medical officer for the American Diabetes Association.

A typical glucometer, test strips, and insulin syringe used to manage diabetes.

The pandemic also took a toll on how well people have managed their diabetes over the past year and a half, said Boulton, who is also a professor of medicine at the University of Manchester in the UK.

""My fear is we're going to see a tsunami in the next two years of diabetes and its complications because people have missed their screening appointments due to fear of catching Covid-19,"" he said.

Is Covid a trigger for diabetes?

As bad as these numbers are, experts are concerned that Covid-19 might contribute to an even greater problem.

""There may be more people developing diabetes because of Covid,"" Gabbay told CNN.

Boulton echoed that concern: ""There may be a specific Covid-induced diabetes, although there is some debate on that at the moment.""

""Whether new-onset diabetes is likely to remain permanent is not known, as the long-term follow-up of these patients is limited,"" the study reported.

It's very possible that Covid-19 is not the culprit. Blood sugar abnormalities could be triggered by the stress of an infection and the steroids used to fight Covid-19 inflammation, Gabbay said.

People also may have had diabetes that was not previously diagnosed. The IDF estimates that of the 537 million adults living with diabetes around the world, almost half (44.7%) are as yet undiagnosed.

But there is also evidence that SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes Covid-19, can bind to the ACE2 receptors in the islet cells of the pancreas -- the organ that produces the body's insulin, Boulton and Gabbay told CNN.

""The virus attacks those cells in the pancreas and interferes with their production of insulin, so that may be another mechanism,"" Gabbay said. ""And those individuals that are diagnosed in the hospital with diabetes for the first time, through whichever mechanism, sadly do worse.""

Early identification is key

Reversing the rising tide of diabetes cases requires early identification. Nipping Type 2 diabetes in the pre-diabetic stages is preferred, since it's before the body begins to suffer damage from irregular blood sugars and lifestyle changes are easier to implement.

Studies in Finland a few decades ago found that people with ""very slight elevated blood sugar"" who followed a sensible diet and regular exercise ""had a 54% reduction in proceeding to Type 2 diabetes,"" Boulton said.

""And it didn't have to be flogging yourself in the gym,"" he added. ""It's sensible exercising, walking instead of riding the bus and walking up the stairs instead of taking the elevator, that can do the trick.""

Two recent studies found that adding about a third of a cup of fruit or vegetables to your daily diet could cut your risk of developing Type 2 diabetes by 25%, while higher consumptions of whole grains, such as brown bread and oatmeal, could cut the risk by 29%.

Even full-flown diabetes can be put into remission, Gabbay said, with a regime of diet, exercise and stress reduction and proper use of medications.

""People in remission may still be at risk for some of the long-term complications, and therefore, they still need to be monitored, with quarterly blood tests, a yearly eye and foot test, and yearly screening for kidney disease and cholesterol levels,"" he said.

To determine if you are at risk for Type 2 diabetes, the American Diabetes Association has a 60-second online test. After answering a few questions about family history, age, gender and physical activity, the test spits out an answer.

Being over age 60, overweight, having had gestational diabetes while pregnant, having a family history of diabetes, currently living with high blood pressure and a lack of physical exercise all raise your risk."

The reserve/Covid-19 list is for players who either test positive for the novel coronavirus or who have been in close contact with someone who is infected.

Rodgers is expected to play in the team's Week 10 tilt against the Seattle Seahawks Sunday.

The 37-year-old drew criticism for misleading reporters after announcing in August he was ""immunized"" when asked if he was vaccinated against the coronavirus.

scared about the possible side effects from the Johnson & Johnson vaccine. Earlier this month, Rodgers said on ""The Pat McAfee Show"" he was unvaccinated because he has an allergy to an ingredient in the Moderna and Pfizer vaccines and wasscared about the possible side effects from the Johnson & Johnson vaccine.

He said he consulted with podcast host Joe Rogan and took his advice on how he treated his own Covid-19. Rogan announced in September he tested positive for the virus and said he embarked on a fringe treatment regime. Rodgers said this month the decision to seek alternative treatments was ""what was best for my body.""

He added he was disappointed with the treatment he received in the media, adding the media was on a ""witch hunt"" to find out which players were vaccinated and blamed reporters for him saying he was ""immunized"" back in August, saying if any reporter had asked a follow-up question, he would have explained he's ""not an anti-vax flat earther,"" but a ""critical thinker.""

Tuesday, Rodgers reappeared on the show and took ""full responsibility"" for his earlier comments.

""I shared an opinion that is polarizing, I get it. I misled some people about my status, which I take full responsibility of those comments,"" he said.

""I understand that this issue, in general, is very charging to a lot of people because we are talking about public health. I totally respect that,"" Rodgers said Tuesday. ""I made a decision that was in the best interest based on consulting with my doctors. And I understand that not everybody is going to understand that necessarily. But I respect everybody's opinion.""

He added ""in the end, I have to stay true to who I am and what I'm about. And I stand behind the things that I said.""

Also this week, the NFL fined the Green Bay Packers, Rodgers and teammate Allen Lazard after a review found the team and its two players violated Covid-19 protocols.

The Packers were fined $300,000, while Rodgers and Lazard were each fined $14,650 for attending a team Halloween party despite being unvaccinated, which was a violation of protocols prohibiting unvaccinated players from gathering outside of team facilities in a group of more than three players.

""We respect the League's findings and we recognize the importance of adherence to the COVID protocols to keep our team and organization safe and healthy,"" Packers President and CEO Mark Murphy told CNN. ""We will continue to educate the team regarding the importance of the protocols and remain committed to operating within the protocols."""

Health officials are recommending third and even fourth shots to boost Covid-19 resistance for people with certain conditions, but that hasn't eased the fears of some immunocompromised people.

Linder, 34, received the life-changing gift of a kidney from his wife, Emily, in September 2019. He will be on immunosuppressants for the rest of his life to keep his body from rejecting the organ.

In March 2020, as Covid-19 cases started to shut down workplaces and cities , Emily moved in with her parents for months because she works with the homeless and people in the prison system and did not want to get her husband sick.

The coronavirus vaccines brought some hope for the Linders, who live in Akron, Ohio. Andrew Linder had two doses of the Pfizer vaccine and later an additional dose and a booster . Hope quickly turned to heartbreak.

""I had no antibodies whatsoever. That was shocking and scary and sucky for sure,"" Linder told CNN. ""I almost feel just as unsafe or if not potentially a little bit more unsafe now than at the beginning of the pandemic, just for the fact that I could get it at this point in time.""

The pandemic isn't over for many

Linder is one of many moderately to severely immunocompromised people trying to protect themselves as a number of people across the US are going back to some version of their normal lives.

The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates about 9 million people who live in the US , or about 3% of the population , are moderately to severely immunocompromised. That includes people in active treatment for cancers of the blood or for solid tumors, certain organ transplant and stem cell recipients, people with advanced or untreated HIV, and those who take high-dose corticosteroids or other drugs that may suppress their immune system.

A new study published by the CDC last week suggests people with compromised immune systems may need to receive three doses of a coronavirus vaccine and a booster shot to get as much protection afforded by two doses to those who are not immunocompromised. The effectiveness of the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines against Covid-19 hospitalization was 77% among immunocompromised adults versus 90% among immunocompetent adults.

For transplant recipients like Linder and some other members of the immunocompromised community, the research showed that vaccine effectiveness was lower than that.

Feeling more free to go out

CNN followed up with five immunocompromised people interviewed in March 2020. For some, like Linder, life really hasn't changed much because of their lack of immunity. Others have gotten a sense of security after getting vaccinations and booster shots.

For Courtney Hodge, a single mom from outside Pittsburgh, living through the pandemic has brought her a new sense of clarity, and she said she's trying to live with less fear.

Last year ""made me reevaluate my entire life because you can die that quickly,"" Hodge told CNN.

Courtney Hodge is a single mom to her college-aged son, Austin.

The 39-year-old has asthma and several autoimmune disorders, such as Graves' disease, fibromyalgia and chronic fatigue syndrome. Given how suppressed her immune system is, Hodge worries she wouldn't be able to fight off the damage coronavirus does to someone's lungs.

""I am fully vaccinated with the booster, (so) I've been going out more and talking to more people than I think I have in my entire life,"" Hodge said. She said she received a booster in August and would consider a fourth dose if needed.

Being vaccinated and boosted has also given Hodge the confidence to feel safe going to craft and vendor shows to further the candy business she started during the pandemic.

""I'm not as anxious, and I don't feel impending doom anymore,"" she said. ""Even if I get sick with the vaccine, my chances of dying are not as high without the vaccine.""

She's back to grocery shopping

Embracing life and trying to get back out into the world is also what Danielle Grijalva has tried to focus on, despite having a few people around her get sick and losing a friend to Covid-19, she said.

Grijalva received her first and second Covid-19 shots in April and May, respectively, and she said being vaccinated changed her outlook, allowing her to shift from mostly staying at home to feeling safe enough to grocery shop or see friends.

""Now I can I feel comfortable with walking in and shopping, and I keep my distance,"" the 45-year-old said. ""I just have decided that I am not going to live in fear.""

Danielle Grijalva is living in less fear now that she's been vaccinated.

The mother of two from California was diagnosed in 2018 with a pain condition called fibromyalgia, chronic fatigue syndrome and several strains of echoviruses, which were found in her stomach.

However, her conditions don't put her among the group of immunocompromised people recommended to get an additional dose, and it hasn't yet been six months since her primary vaccination.

She said she will be eligible for her booster shot this month. Regardless, she said she is happy to see things reopening in the US and is enjoying seeing good friends and feeling a little bit of normalcy again.

She still caught Covid-19

There are days when Brittania Powell can't get out of bed. When she got Covid-19 in 2020, she had symptoms for a month.

But not all the immunocompromised people CNN followed up with were able to stay healthy and Covid-19 free.

Brittania Powell, a student at The Ohio State University, barely left her home for two months last fall until her family encouraged her to come work the polls in Ohio on Election Day 2020, she said.

Powell was diagnosed with the autoimmune disease lupus when she was 14. She also has an autoimmune disease called rheumatoid arthritis, anemia and lupus nephritis, which inflames her kidneys. She doesn't know if she'll wake up to swollen joints or if she's going to be able to get around on any given day.

The 22-year-old said she and the other poll workers tried to disinfect common surfaces and keep things clean, but some of the people who came to vote were not wearing masks.

""I was double-masking, although I was wearing gloves, but I still caught (Covid-19),"" she said.

Powell felt like she had the flu for a week and only coughed for one day, so she didn't think she had Covid-19 at the time, she said. The next week she was very nauseous and had stomach issues, which sent her to the emergency room.

The next morning, she said she got a positive test result. The stomach issues stayed with her and she didn't feel better for a month. Despite feeling sick, Powell said she stayed positive and tried not to stress as she recovered.

She received both doses of the vaccine this spring, and she said she's not in a rush to get a booster yet. However, she has a message for other people.

""You're not going to know who is immunocompromised just by looking at them,"" Powell said. ""I would just be considerate of others around you, even if you don't want to get the vaccine, wear your mask at least. Follow the safety protocols that we use so that you're not risking others' lives.""

She's still worried about her health

For Eileen Davidson, getting treatments for her rheumatoid arthritis became a difficulty during the pandemic.

The need to have people watching out for those who may be more susceptible to Covid-19 is real for Eileen Davidson, a Canadian writer for an arthritis website.

The 35-year-old is a single mother with rheumatoid arthritis. She lives with her 8-year-old son, Jacob, in Vancouver, British Columbia.

""Some people kind of think the pandemic may be ending -- it doesn't really end for somebody who's immunocompromised,"" Davidson said.

At first, the lockdown was a good thing, as Davidson said she could relax. But not having access to physical therapy and her gym made it hard to manage her chronic condition.

""I went into a flare and there was a lot of stress,"" she said. ""Even just the stress around the pandemic can put somebody into higher disease activity.""

After waiting and watching the first Americans get their vaccines, Davidson was able to get her first shot in April and her second in June, as Canadian experts advised extending the time between doses. She also got a booster shot two weeks ago.

But another stressor popped up when demand for the medication she uses to manage her rheumatoid arthritis -- a biologic called Actemra , or tocilizumab -- escalated.

In June, the US Food and Drug Administration gave Actemra an emergency authorization use to treat hospitalized Covid-19 patients. It's a monoclonal antibody therapy that helps reduce inflammation that can make patients sicker.

""I'm worried that my medication that I desperately need and have gone through so many to find the right treatment for me, (that there) will be a shortage of it because people are refusing to get their vaccine,"" Davidson said.

They just want to go back to normal

Among those who are immunocompromised, a common thread is the yearning to live their lives. For Linder, the thought of not getting to resume some shred of normalcy at some point is overwhelming.

""For me not to be able to live a life that again, I fought so hard to get and that my wife donated a part of her body to me for us to live a life together, it just it hurts,"" he said. ""It cuts so deep that it's a pain that I can't explain.""

Linder said a stranger in a grocery store, where Linder goes when he's become stir crazy and just needs to get out of the house, once yelled at him that he doesn't need a mask and the pandemic is over. Note: That stranger is wrong. Neither of those things are true.

He said he feels ""a lot of jealousy, a lot of envy because the message that has been clearly pushed into the society right now is that it's like if I don't want to risk death, I need to just stay home, and I need to stay in my house forever,"" he said.

Linder dreams of finally taking a honeymoon with his wife -- their two-year anniversary is approaching in December. That trip is not happening anytime soon, because they know it's not safe for him to fly.

For now, he hopes he can see his sister, her husband and his nephew for the holidays. They aren't sure how that would look, but he said it would be nice to spend a holiday with his family for the first time in two years."

The half-hour town hall is part of Sesame Workshop's Caring for Each Other initiative. Funded by the nonprofit's Critical Needs Response Fund , the initiative provides free resources for parents and families during the Covid-19 pandemic.

What do kids of that age really want to know?

Will it hurt?

Ouch. ""By far the No. 1 thing that I hear is, 'I don't want this to hurt. How bad is it going to hurt?'"" pediatrician and child development expert Dr. David Hill told CNN last month

""I never lie to kids. I never tell them it's not going to hurt at all or you're not going to feel it, because it's just not true,"" said Hill, who is a co-host on the American Academy of Pediatrics' flagship podcast, ""Pediatrics on Call.""

Parents are bound to hear this question before they get into the car to go get the vaccine, and Hill has some ready advice:

""You want to be honest. You want to say, 'You know what, it's going to hurt just a little bit, but it's not going to hurt as bad as some other things that happen to you all the time -- like falling down when you're running or stubbing your toe.'""

Can you keep it from hurting?

Being told it will hurt -- even just a bit -- might still be alarming for some kids, especially those who are hesitant about needles. There are things parents (and health care practitioners) can do just before and during the shot that can help, Hill said.

Give the child a sense of control. Talk with the child about what they can do, such as deciding where they would like to receive the shot.

""You like to play baseball and you're right-handed, right? Maybe you want to have the shot in your left arm instead of your right,"" Hill said.

Kelly Foy and Pat McLarney, who are both child life education specialists at Connecticut Children's Medical Center, told CNN in a prior interview that younger children might benefit from advance role-playing, by administering vaccines to stuffed animals or dolls before their shot. Older children might write a list of questions for the nurse and doctor, they said.

Use distraction and calming techniques. Hill suggests talking to children in advance about how they can use breathing and distraction techniques to reduce their focus on the shot.

He suggests asking your child: ""'Do you know that if you take a breath and blow out really slowly things hurt less? They also hurt less if you're singing or if you're holding my hand.'

""If you can reassure children that yes, you're going to have control, and yes, it's going to hurt a little, but we're going to help you keep it from hurting as much as you think, those things can be very helpful,"" Hill said.

A child could also hold some ice to their arm to numb it just before the shot, Foy and McLarney suggested. (Buy an instant cold-pack to use or check with your pediatrician in advance to see if they can refrigerate one.)

Pop-it toys, fidget spinners, bubble wrap, squeeze balls, even vibrating toys can also be great distractions, they said. Older children may benefit from creating a playlist of songs to listen to, playing a video game, or cuing up a distracting video to watch.

Play a fun activity to do after. Kids get excited about family outings, visits to their favorite places and play dates, experts say. So plan something fun they can look forward to.

Positive attitudes are key

Getting vaccinated is a positive thing, and parents should emphasize the benefits, experts stress, such as more play dates with friends and seeing relatives or family friends who have been off limits due to age or immune status.

Being upbeat about all the benefits of the vacciine will help your child, experts say.

""Get together, masks off, give grandparents or whoever a hug ... you get everyone vaccinated and that's exactly the scenario that can sort of play out,"" Gupta told CNN anchor John Berman on CNN's New Day this week

""The data has been really compelling. We knew how good the vaccines were from the initial data: They reduce the likelihood of infection 11.5 times and reduce the likelihood of getting severely ill 20 times. They're not perfect. They're really, really good,"" Gupta said.

As far as kids are concerned, this is just one more shot just like all the others they get, Hill stressed.

""How they react is going to be very largely -- if not completely -- dependent on how the adults in their lives frame the experience,"" he said.

""If we are expressing concern, skepticism or worry, they're absolutely going to pick up on that. If we're expressing confidence and relief, they're going to pick up on that as well. And children are always listening, even when we think they aren't,"" he added.

Mixing Covid-19 and flu vaccine

Many parents want to know if they can get their child immunized from the flu at the same time they are receiving the Covid-19 vaccine.

""The answer is yes,"" Gupta told Berman. In fact, he said, pediatricians often encourage getting multiple vaccines on the same day.

""It's easier that way -- you don't have to keep bringing the child back,"" Gupta said. ""They'll have a sore arm for a couple of days, but get both shots. It may be a worst flu season this year.""

If given at the same time, the vaccines would be given in a different injection site -- for example, in the other arm, or in two different places on the leg, CNN Medical Analyst Dr. Leana Wen told CNN this week

Wen stressed that even healthy children need to get the Covid-19 vaccine as soon as possible.

""About one-third of the children who have been hospitalized from Covid-19 are those with no underlying health conditions. Healthy children can become very sick from coronavirus,"" she said.

Side effects

Speaking of sore arms, what other side effects should parents look for from the Covid-19 vaccine?

The vaccine trials done on thousands of kids age 5 to 11 show very similar side effects to those in adults, but were often milder, said Wen, who is the author of a new book, ""Lifelines: A Doctor's Journey in the Fight for Public Health,"" and the mother of two young kids.

""The most common side effects are soreness at the injection site, fatigue and headache,"" Wen said . ""Some children can experience fever and chills. All of these side effects subside within a couple of days. In fact, the risks of these side effects were lower in the younger kids than in adults -- probably because of the lower dose.""

The authorized dosage for ages 5 to 11 is 10 micrograms, or one-third the 30 microgram dose given to adults and kids age 12 and older.

""Some parents may be worried about long-term side effects,"" Wen added. ""There is no scientific reason to think that this would happen. Side effects from other immunizations occur within the first two or three weeks following the shots, not months afterward.""

One safety concern has been the risk of myocarditis, an inflammation of the heart muscle, and pericarditis, the inflammation around the heart, which has appeared occasionally in younger adults who received the vaccine.

The clinical trials on ages 5 to 11 were careful to track any responses that might be warning signs and saw no cases of myocarditis in the children's trial, said Dr. Emanuel ""Chip"" Walter Jr., chief medical officer of the Duke Human Vaccine Institute and professor of pediatrics at the Duke School of Medicine in Durham, North Carolina, who led one of the trials.

""If a child complained of any pain, chest pain, or shortness of breath, families were immediately called and children were evaluated. So it was examined quite closely in the trial, and there were no cases,"" Walter told CNN in late October.

Can children with food allergies get vaccinated?

There's no reason to avoid the Covid-19 vaccine if your child has a common food allergy, Wen stressed.

""The Covid-19 vaccines do not contain egg products, as some other vaccines do. If your child has a food allergy or had a reaction to another vaccine in the past, that is not a reason to refrain from the Covid-19 vaccine,"" she said.

However, do check with your doctor if your child has had a prior reaction to a vaccine or injectable therapy for another disease, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention advised

""Your doctor will help you decide if it is safe for you to get vaccinated,"" the CDC wrote.

Overall, the only reason not to get this vaccine, according to the CDC, is if the child has a severe allergic reaction to one of its components -- PEG or polysorbate.

""PEG is an ingredient in the mRNA vaccines (Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna), and polysorbate is an ingredient in the J&J/Janssen vaccine,"" the CDC states.

When is my child fully vaccinated?

Just like with adults, a child is considered fully vaccinated two weeks after the second injection. At this point, there is no way for children to be fully vaccinated by Thanksgiving or Hanukkah, experts say. Therefore all precautions, including masking and social distancing from high-risk family members, should be followed.

As long as the first shot is administered by November 19, a child will have full protection for Christmas, Kwanzaa and end-of-year gatherings."

Lorraine Charinda got her first shot of the vaccine on October 23 and her second on Wednesday. It was all thanks to a US church that raised money to get her from the Democratic Republic of Congo to Columbus, Ohio, the church said.

""Everyone else, we are still waiting,"" Charinda told CNN, referring to the millions of people around the world who haven't been offered the chance to get vaccinated. ""So it's shocking to hear that vaccines can even expire and be thrown (away) just because people don't want to be vaccinated. If we had that opportunity, really, it would help us a lot.""

Roughly 1 in 1,000 people in the DRC have received one dose of the Covid-19 vaccine with 4 in 10,000 people fully vaccinated, according to Our World in Data. The numbers are staggering, especially when compared to the more than 1 out of 2 people in the US who have been fully vaccinated , according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

This vaccine disparity across the globe is apparent, especially in Africa. South America, North America, Europe, Asia, Oceania have all administered a single vaccine dose to more than 50% of their populations, while only 7% of the population of Africa has received a dose, the director general of the World Health Organization (WHO) said in October.

For Charinda, who works in a poor, rural area called Kamina, she said they could not find the vaccine anywhere in her province. She did not believe she was set to get the vaccine until she was at the airport.

Charinda waters onion seedlings on the farm in Kamina in July 2020.

""We're trying always to look for the vaccine and we couldn't find it,"" the 32-year-old said. ""And because there were no centers in the province, you had to go somewhere to continue to look for it.""

The experience of the pandemic is even more real to Charinda because she saw her mother fight Covid-19. She met her in Zambia when her mother became ill and she watched her struggle to breathe and battle a fever in June 2021.

""I really didn't know how serious the pandemic was until I saw my mother lie next to me having those symptoms and difficulty breathing, coughing, fever,"" she said. ""It's like it's real when you're looking at it -- it's like staring at you in the face.""

Her mother was sick for 7 to 10 days and sent Charinde back to the DRC so she would not get sick.

By some miracle, Charinda said, she did not get sick after meeting her mom.

""Every time I get a negative result I am like, is this real?"" she said. ""I'm just looking up to the heavens and asking God if this is real.""

With tears in her eyes, Lorraine Charinda receives her second Covid vaccine on Wednesday.

Charinda's vaccine moment came to fruition because of the West Ohio Conference of The United Methodist Church. The conference has had a relationship with the DRC since 2002 and Charinda started working there as a missionary through General Board of Global Ministries in 2018, a spokeswoman for the West Ohio Conference told CNN.

""She is a key leader and her work provides food and financial sustainability for communities across the DRC,"" spokeswoman Kay Panovec wrote.

The organization raised $4,000 within 24 hours in order to bring Charinda to the US, she wrote. The money came from West Ohio congregations and individuals and OhioHealth administered her shots, she added.

Charinda, a native of Zimbabwe, works as an agricultural specialist at Kamisamba Farm . She passionately talked about the work she and others do to train residents on crop and animal production in one of the poorest provinces in the country.

In coming to the US, Charinda said the access Americans have to the vaccine is remarkable. She hopes that her story can help others, she said.

""I encourage people to take vaccines. It's really not a joke and it's not anything about politics or what, but it's something real,"" she said. ""You will not realize it until your loved one gets sick, and the fear is that you have that you don't know that person is going to live."""

New Covid-19 diagnoses are up in about half of US states over the past week. Hospitalizations are up in 11 states, and deaths have risen in 17 states.

US coronavirus cases have plateaued in recent weeks, holding on to about half of the growth from this summer's latest surge.

While new cases have fallen in some states, they're rising in others, particularly some region's cold-weather states.

Southern states that were a large driving force behind this summer's surge now have some of the lowest case rates. Two months ago, Florida and Texas together accounted for nearly a quarter (22%) of all new cases. Now, those two large states account for just 6% of all cases.

Florida sliced new cases to a 10th of what they were two months ago and Texas to a fifth.

That should sound like good news. But with less dramatic decreases in other, less populous states -- and slight increases in some others, particularly in the Northeast and Mountain regions -- overall US numbers are holding steady on the whole.

It's confusing, and the numbers may be sending a mixed message to people. They are not, however, sending a mixed message to epidemiologists, who do not foresee a good winter for the US or for the world.

Too many people remain unvaccinated, and too many continue to defy and even fight advice to wear masks when indoors with other people. This dangerous combination might mean more surges, even if not as high as in the recent past, and in areas beyond those currently seeing rising cases.

""I don't know what's going to happen over the next few weeks. But I have a feeling it's not going to be pretty,"" Michael Osterholm, who heads the center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota, told CNN.

""Today is a really sad day,"" epidemiologist Ali Mokdad, who has been tracking the coronavirus pandemic since the beginning at the University of Washington, told CNN. ""Cases are going up. It was coming down. This is at a time when the United States has all the tools we need to prevent a surge, all the tools we need to save lives. We have the best vaccines, and we have plenty of them,"" he said.

""And people are not willing to get them.""

False sense of security

Mokdad said states such as Florida have a false sense of security.

""Florida has a large population of the elderly, who went and got vaccinated. And the young people simply got infected. So the virus ran out of people to infect,"" he said.

But he said immunity on both groups is waning.

""There will be a lot of winter travel to Florida,"" he said. ""Infections will start all over again,"" he predicted. ""We are so interconnected.""

Diagnoses and hospitalizations are both headed upward in Michigan, with hospitalizations up 20% in the past week, according to state data.

""Metro Detroit once again is becoming a hotspot,"" Dr. Nick Gilpin, director of infection prevention and epidemiology at Beaumont Health, a health system in southeast Michigan, told a news conference Thursday.

""I have a feeling we'll be in this world for the next couple months because I don't see much that can change this unless people start radically changing behavior. This could be a four or five month affair,"" Gilpin added.

Like Mokdad, Gilpin blames the unvaccinated and a refusal to wear masks. It's hitting hospitals and clinics hard, he said.

""I mean, it's brutal. No one wants to see these Covid patients this late. But we're masking up and trying to help people get better,"" Gilpin said.

""That said, there's probably no hospital in the state that isn't dealing with staffing shortages. It's difficult, especially as we look to a fourth surge that could last through the winter. This surge is shaping up more to be a marathon than a sprint.""

Millions still unvaccinated can fuel new surges

In Colorado, where cases were up 30% in the past week, according to Johns Hopkins University data, Gov. Jared Polis declared the entire state to be at high risk of Covid-19 transmission or exposure and signed an executive order saying everybody over 18 was eligible for a booster dose of vaccine.

""We want to ensure that Coloradans have every tool they need to protect themselves from this deadly virus and to help reduce the stress on our hospitals and health care workers. Every Coloradan is now eligible to get the booster so they can protect themselves and their families,"" Polis said in a statement.

Mokdad approves. ""Science is telling us we need three doses to be immune,"" he said. ""We are losing our credibility as scientists unless you say it -- we need three doses to be protected.""

The US Food and Drug Administration and the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have OK'd booster doses for most US adults, and the FDA is considering extending authorization for booster doses of Pfizer's vaccine to all adults.

Osterholm thinks boosting people will help -- but says it's far more important to get more people vaccinated in the first place.

""If we see upticks in L.A. or New York City, we could just as easily find ourselves back to where we were. At this point, there's no evidence of that happening,"" he said in his podcast this week.

""But I must tell you that given the rates of vaccination ... we surely could see major surges in both of those metropolitan areas where with the population density being what it is, could really, truly raise the number of national cases in short order,"" he added.

An estimated 60 million Americans remain unvaccinated. That's plenty of people who can help fuel new surges, Osterholm said.

""Overall, there's still a lot of human wood left for this coronavirus forest fire to burn,"" he said.

Even in states, cities and counties with high vaccination rates, enough people remain unvaccinated or undervaccinated to help keep the virus spreading. And if immunity is waning as quickly as some studies indicate it may be, Osterholm fears more breakthrough infections, even among the vaccinated.

What could be ahead this winter

Osterholm is pessimistic about the coming weeks. ""That fact, combined with Delta, schools and upcoming holidays, has me skeptical that we won't be seeing new hotspots emerge in this country over the next several weeks and months. So where do I see us going? I think we will continue to see surges. They may not be nearly as high as the ones we've just had, but they will occur.""

And they will not be restricted to the current hotspots, Mokdad predicted. The holidays will make sure of that. ""People are moving out and about like there is no Covid-19,"" he said.""We are going to see Americans traveling -- Thanksgiving and then all the way through New Year. We are going to see a surge, and that surge is going to be very bad.""

AAA is predicting travel for Thanksgiving will rebound to near pre-pandemic levels, with 53.4 million Americans expected to travel for the holiday -- a 13% increase from last year.

And plenty of states have such low vaccination levels that they're bonfires waiting to be ignited, Mokdad said.

""I mean, West Virginia [is] 41.1% fully vaccinated. So 60% of the population, at least, don't have immunity against infection,"" he said.

""So, what do you expect? We're going to have a surge. If you look at Montana, 51%. Wyoming, 44.6%. I mean, you could go on and on. There's so many states right now below 50. Louisiana, 48.1%. Alabama, 45.2%.""

These same states, Mokdad and Osterholm both pointed out, have populations largely resistant to mask use, as well.

""Nobody is listening,"" Mokdad said morosely. He said he and fellow epidemiologists were discussing how they could bring attention to the dire situation.

""Some of us we were talking about going on a hunger strike. We are really frustrated. It's depressing that we know how protect our population and we are not doing it,"" he said."

Hong Kong (CNN Business) Few issues are more important to Beijing than food security. For centuries, China's rulers have grappled with the challenges of feeding a large, expanding population. Droughts, floods and famines feature prominently throughout Chinese history — and rebellions launched by starving peasants toppled numerous imperial dynasties.

But the government's latest attempt to head off concerns about pricing and supply appears to be spiraling out of control.

A missive about stockpiling food from China's Ministry of Commerce sparked panic buying among the public and frenzied online speculation this week.

At first glance, the notice doesn't seem too different from the typical directives the Chinese government has sent in the past stressing the need to shore up supplies.

This one orders local authorities to ensure that their citizens have an ""adequate supply"" of essentials this winter. It also instructs those governments to keep food costs stable — a point of concern in recent weeks, as extreme weather, energy shortages and Covid-19 restrictions threaten supply.

But Monday's directive has attracted the attention of everyday Chinese in a way that few other government notices have.

In part, that appears to be because it includes rare language about the need for local authorities to encourage families to stockpile ""daily necessities."" Even if the notice wasn't intended for the average household to read, many online have seized on it as a personal warning.

The government ""didn't even tell us to stock goods when the Covid outbreak erupted in early 2020,"" wrote one user on the Twitter-like Weibo service earlier this week.

The reaction has since escalated. One video posted on Weibo by the state owned news magazine China News Weekly shows long lines of shoppers at grocery stores in Changzhou, a city in Jiangsu province. Their carts are stacked full of produce and other supplies, while shelves throughout the stores are empty.

The tragedy remains within living memory for many in the country. And while China's economy has since undergone a dramatic transformation, concerns about food security linger: The government, for example, recently unveiled an ""action plan"" encouraging people not to order more food than they need, and to report restaurants that waste food.

Still, the unease caused by the commerce ministry notice has been unusually intense. Rampant speculation has even linked the call to stockpile food with rising tensions between Beijing and Taipei . China considers Taiwan an ""inseparable part"" of its territory, even though the Chinese Communist Party has never ruled the self-governing island.

There's nothing whatsoever to substantiate any rumors that China is preparing for imminent war. But the online panic does suggest some brewing tension, according to Willy Lam, an adjunct professor in the Department of History at the Chinese University of Hong Kong.

""It is a reflection of the tense geopolitical situation between China and neighboring countries,"" he said.

Lam also pointed to several economic anxieties that may be contributing to the turmoil. This year's energy crunch forced factories to suspend some production and triggered blackouts for households — problems that in some cases ""happened without any prior notice from the government,"" he said.

""It reflects the anxiety of the people regarding further drastic rises in food [costs] and also a mistrust of the government,"" Lam added.

The Chinese government and some state media outlets have tried to allay fears about food shortages.

Zhu Xiaoliang, a commerce ministry official, told state broadcaster CCTV this week that there's plenty of supplies to go around. Zhu stressed that the directive was intended for local authorities.

The Jiangsu Department of Emergency Management, meanwhile, acknowledged concerns about ""emergency supplies"" on its WeChat account Tuesday. But the agency said any recommendations for stockpiling are ""normal"" and intended to ""improve the public's awareness of disaster prevention.""

The government's commitment to a zero-Covid policy — even as countries around the world reopen and learn to live with the coronavirus — is also likely a factor. Just a single case can spur Chinese authorities into action, locking down entire areas and carrying out mass tests or quarantine requirements.

Such measures ""will likely impact residents going to shops, and also impact the operating hours of markets,"" said Chenjun Pan, a senior analyst at Rabobank who researches agriculture in China.

Wang Hongcun , an official with the Beijing Municipal Commerce Bureau, acknowledged last week that strict containment measures may be contributing to the rising cost of food, adding that the cost of transiting across regions could increase. He pointed out that the prices of some vegetables in the nation's capital had soared 50% or more in October.

Lam said Beijing is not likely to change course, either, meaning that cities have to prepare to endure potentially long lockdowns as the government tries to keep its coronavirus case count low.

""This is a preparation for the fact that these lockdown conditions will continue, even though by and large, the total numbers for China are actually very low compared to other countries,"" he added. ""It's unlikely that Beijing will stop this zero tolerance policy.""

Harris will sit down for a bilateral meeting with French President Emmanuel Macron at the Élysée Palace next Wednesday before delivering remarks at the Macron-hosted Paris Peace Forum and participating in a multilateral conference on Libya.

Harris' trip comes less than two months after France temporarily recalled its ambassador to the US to protest a US nuclear submarine deal with Australia, which sank a separate French contract to build conventional submarines for Australia. President Joe Biden last week sat down with Macron on the sidelines of the G20 summit in Rome and acknowledged that the US had been ""clumsy"" in its handling of the matter.

""The key message for this meeting is the importance of this relationship and the fact that US-French partnership matters to the world,"" a senior administration official said of the Harris-Macron meeting.

Harris will be the most senior American official to attend the Paris Peace Forum since it was launched in 2018, though senior administration officials declined to say whether her attendance was part of an effort to mend the US-French rift.

The senior administration official said the Biden administration is ""forward-looking"" in its relationship with France and that Harris will look to strengthen French-American cooperation ""in concrete ways,"" though the official declined to say specifically how Harris would seek to improve the relationship.

The official said Harris and Macron plan to have a ""wide-ranging discussion across a range of issues to include the bilateral relationship, European security, the Indo-Pacific, global health, space and a number of other subjects.""

A second senior official said Harris' remarks at the Paris Peace Forum on November 11 -- which will focus this year on global health and post-Covid recovery -- will address ""big, converging global crises"" with a focus on ""the challenge of rising inequality and the need for leaders around the world to join together and take bold action.""

Harris will join Macron and other world leaders for a dinner following the forum.

She is set to arrive in Paris on Tuesday and return to the US the following Saturday.

Officials said Harris will tour the Institut Pasteur, a biomedical research institute, after her arrival and meet with French and American scientists working on Covid-19 and pandemic research.

Harris will visit the Suresnes American Cemetery, just outside of Paris, on the eve of Veterans Day and participate in an Armistice Day ceremony the following day, visits intended to demonstrate ""the years t hat France and the United States have stood together, our shared values and our commitment to continue doing the right things together around the world,"" the first senior administration official said.

""The vice president is attending to show US support for the Libyan people as they work to reestablish their sovereignty and establish lasting peace,"" the second senior administration official said. ""We want to show our support for the Libyan people as they move towards national elections and as they focus on the importance of the withdrawal of foreign forces and mercenaries and fighters.""

The official said Harris will also express ""deep concern for human rights and the situation of migrants and refugees."""

In a blistering 22-page opinion, the Fifth US Circuit Court of Appeals said that the vaccine mandate issued by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) is ""fatally flawed"" and both ""overinclusive"" and ""underinclusive.""

""Indeed, the Mandate's strained prescriptions combine to make it the rare government pronouncement that is both overinclusive (applying to employers and employees in virtually all industries and workplaces in America, with little attempt to account for the obvious differences between the risks facing, say, a security guard on a lonely night shift, and a meatpacker working shoulder to shoulder in a cramped warehouse) and underinclusive (purporting to save employees with 99 or more coworkers from a 'grave danger' in the workplace, while making no attempt to shield employees with 98 or fewer coworkers from the very same threat),"" the court wrote.

The conservative-dominated court last Saturday temporarily blocked the OSHA rule that requires employers with 100 or more employees to ensure their employees are fully vaccinated against Covid-19 or undergo regular testing and wear face masks in the workplace.

OSHA, which falls under the US Labor Department, earlier this month unveiled the vaccine rules that were set to take effect January 4.

Life expectancy fell the most in Spain and the United States, the group said, with the United States losing 1.6 years of life per capita on average over the year and a half of the pandemic so far, and Spain losing 1.5 years, the OECD said.

""COVID 19 contributed, directly and indirectly, to a 16% increase in the expected number of deaths in 2020 and the first half of 2021 across OECD countries,"" the group said in its report.

The global death toll for Covid-19 passed the 5 million mark last week, according to John Hopkins University . The virus has killed more than 750,000 people in the United States alone. Several reports have shown it has impacted life expectancy in the US

The report found little change in which countries enjoy the longest comparative life expectancies. ""Japan, Switzerland and Spain lead a large group of 27 OECD countries in which life expectancy at birth exceeded 80 years in 2019,"" the report reads.

""A second group, including the United States and a number of central and eastern European countries, had a life expectancy between 77 and 80 years. Mexico and Latvia had the lowest life expectancy, at less than 76 years."" Life expectancy has been growing over the past century, although that growth had slowed in recent years and the pandemic has had an acute effect.

""COVID 19 has disproportionately hit vulnerable populations. More than 90% of recorded COVID 19 deaths have occurred among those aged 60 and over. There has also been a clear social gradient, with disadvantaged people, those living in deprived areas, and most ethnic minorities and immigrants at higher risk of infection and death,"" the report added.

The OECD, which groups wealthy and mid-tier nations, and whose reports set some international standards for comparing spending, standards of living, health outcomes and other national goals, releases regular reports that attempt to parse out how health spending affects outcomes such as cancer care and overall life expectancy.

This year's report finds the death rate from Covid-19 in the US was close to the average for the OECD.

The group, which reports on nations as diverse as India, Indonesia, Japan, Switzerland and the US, analyzed Covid-19 death rates to find 1,824 Covid-19 deaths per 1 million population in 2020 and the first half of 2021 for the US. The US had 13,197 Covid-19 cases per 100,000 people -- higher than the OECD average. Plus, the US has about average vaccination rates, with 55% of the population fully vaccinated at the time the report was written.

The UK had 2,232 Covid-19 deaths per million population, 11,608 Covid-19 cases per 100,000 population and a vaccination rate of 66%. Japan had 117 Covid-19 deaths per 1 million population, 1,347 Covid-19 cases per 100,000 population and a vaccination rate of 61.2%. Canada had 699 Covid-19 deaths per 1 million population, 4,347 Covid-19 cases per 100,000 population and a vaccination rate of 71.2%.

Pandemic raises global rates of depression, anxiety

The report found big increases in certain mental illnesses with the pandemic.

""The mental health impact of the pandemic has been huge, with prevalence of anxiety and depression more than double levels observed pre-crisis in most countries with available data, most notably in Mexico, the United Kingdom and the United States,"" it said.

""The prevalence of anxiety and depression in early 2020 was double or more the level observed in previous years in a number of countries, including Belgium, France, the United Kingdom and the United States,"" it added.

""In France, the United Kingdom, and the United States, prevalence of symptoms of anxiety and depression increased during periods when there were peaks in COVID 19 infections and deaths, and when there were increased containment measures in place,"" it said, citing reports from public health departments in France and the UK and the US National Center for Health Statistics.

""The mental health impact of the pandemic has been particularly hard for the doctors, nurses, long-term care workers, and other health care workers working in close proximity to patients,"" the organization said in its report.

""Healthcare workers have reported high rates of anxiety, depression, burnout, and turnover since the onset of the pandemic,"" the report reads.

""In the United States, a survey of frontline health workers found that more than three fifths (62%) reported that the stress or worry over COVID 19 affected their mental health negatively, and close to half (49%) reported that the stress had affected their physical health,"" it adds. ""Almost one third of respondents reported needing or having received mental health services due to the pandemic.""

And nurses may have been affected more than doctors. ""A survey of 33 national nursing associations found that three fifths reported sometimes or regularly receiving reports from nurses about mental health distress linked to the pandemic,"" the report added, citing a survey conducted by the International Council of Nurses.

""In a survey of the workforce across the European Union, 70% of workers in the health sector -- more than any other sector of the workforce -- report that they believed their job put them at risk of COVID 19 infection,"" the report reads.

""In a March 2020 survey of health care workers in Italy, close to half (49%) exhibited symptoms of post-traumatic stress syndrome and one quarter symptoms of depression. Frontline workers had significantly higher odds of exhibiting post-traumatic stress syndrome than those who did not report working with COVID 19 patients,"" it added.

""An April 2020 survey of health care professionals in Spain found that close to three fifths of respondents reported symptoms of anxiety (59%) and/or post-traumatic stress disorder (57%), with close to half (46%) exhibiting symptoms of depression. In England (United Kingdom), nearly half of respondents to the NHS (National Health Service) staff survey (44%) reported feeling unwell due to work-related stress over the previous year, a 9% increase from 2019.""

Pandemic causes spike in health care spending, too

The pandemic caused a spike in health spending across many of the organization's 38 member nations, the report found.

""The COVID-19 pandemic has led to a sharp increase in health spending across the OECD. Coupled with reductions in economic activity, the average health spending to GDP (gross domestic product) ratio jumped from 8.8% in 2019 to 9.7% in 2020, across OECD countries with available data.

""Countries severely affected by the pandemic reported unprecedented increases. The United Kingdom estimated an increase from 10.2% in 2019 to 12.8% in 2020, while Slovenia anticipated its share of spending on health rising from 8.5% to more than 10%,"" the report reads.

The ratio for the US was the highest for all the OECD by far in 2019, at 16.8% of GDP, but a figure was not available for 2020. ""With the onset of the COVID 19 pandemic, initial data for 2020 points to a sharp increase in overall health spending, of around 5.1% on average,"" the report reads.

And the US remained at the head of the pack in terms of overall health spending. ""The United States spends considerably more than any other country (almost $11,000 per person, adjusted for purchasing power, in 2019),"" the report reads. For comparison, Japan spends an average of $4,691 per person on health care and the UK spends $4,500.

Health care spending per capita is also high in Switzerland, Norway and Germany.

Seven countries spend much less per person on average on health care but have higher than average life expectancy, the report noted. ""These seven countries are Italy, Korea, Portugal, Spain, Slovenia, Greece and Israel,"" the report reads. ""The only country in the bottom right quadrant is the United States, with much higher spending than in all other OECD countries, but lower life expectancy than the OECD average."""

Newsmax White House correspondent Emerald Robinson returned from a high-profile Twitter suspension Tuesday, but was then permanently banned almost immediately for once again posting about how vaccines are Satanic.

Robinson was suspended from Twitter last week after posting a tweet claiming that the COVID-19 vaccines contain an ingredient that makes recipients glow and enables them to be “tracked.”

“Dear Christians: the vaccines contain a bioluminescent marker called LUCIFERASE so that you can be tracked,” Robinson posted. “Read the last book of the New Testament to see how this ends.”

Luciferase is a chemical whose name is not a reference to Satan as Robinson implied; rather, it’s an enzyme which is most widely-known as what makes fireflies glow. But while researchers at numerous universities have studied it as part of developing tests, vaccines, and treatments for COVID-19, luciferase is not in any of the vaccines that have been approved for use or emergency use by the Food and Drug Administration.

Robinson was also taken off the air at Newsmax, a conservative outlet where she and others have routinely boosted conspiracy theories about the 2020 election. Elliot Jacobsen, the network’s chief content officer, said in a statement after Robinson’s tweet that Newsmax is ""a strong proponent that Covid 19 vaccines are overarchingly safe and effective.""

Days later, the network announced it would implement an employee vaccine mandate.

Robinson’s Twitter account was reinstated on Tuesday, and after linking to her Substack, she once again posted that the vaccines contain Luciferase. “One more thing: the new COVID-19 antibody test is called SATiN and it uses Luciferase. No, I’m not kidding,” Robinson wrote. “It’s not an accident that they’ve given this name to this test. It’s a warning.”

After this, Twitter banned Robinson from the platform for “repeated violations of our COVID-19 misinformation policy.”

The first part of Robinson’s tweet is true, sort of. Researchers at the University of Toronto announced in May that they had developed a rapid, low-cost test for COVID-19 called SaTiN, or Serological Assay based on split Tripart Nanoluciferase. The University of Toronto said at the time that the test proved to have “excellent sensitivity, specificity, operability and quantifiability, as well as great scientific and commercial possibilities,” and that it could cost as little as $2 per sample.

What’s not true is Robinson’s implication that this test, which is not approved for use in the United States, is a harbinger of the end times. Robinson posted on Substack Tuesday that she’s “not getting anywhere near this dark stuff.”

“You don’t have to be a Christian to understand: names matter,” she wrote.

It’s worth noting that the enzyme that makes Brazilian click beetles glow is called emerald luciferase. No, I’m not kidding."

Dharmalingam, sentenced to death in Singapore for trafficking heroin. Photo: MOHD RASFAN / AFP

In a twist few saw coming, Singapore’s highest court has delayed the execution of an intellectually disabled man convicted of drug trafficking after he was found to have tested positive for COVID-19.



Addressing a crowded courtroom today, three judges adjourned the hearing and announced their decision to delay the execution until proceedings could be concluded. They ruled that the court felt it would be “inappropriate” to proceed with the execution—originally scheduled for Nov. 10—“given the circumstances.”

“If the applicant has been afflicted by COVID-19... it's our view that the execution cannot take place anyway,” said Justice Andrew Pang.

Malaysian Nagaenthran Dharmalingam has been on death row in Singapore for more than a decade, and is set to be the first person executed in the city-state since the pandemic began. He was arrested and detained in 2009 at the age of 21 by Singaporean immigration officers at a border checkpoint when he was found with 42.72 grams of heroin strapped to his thigh.

Nagaenthran was sentenced to death by hanging under Singapore’s strict drug laws. Several failed appeals have followed, including a plea for clemency, despite assessments by psychiatrists concluding that he has an IQ of 69 and an “intellectual disability.”

Earlier reports stated that he had been in isolation while on death row, with the announcement that he had contracted COVID-19 surprising many. His execution was also stayed on Monday, awaiting an appeal, after a judge stated ""there is no credible basis"" for claims he held a mental age of someone below 18.

Since testing positive, members of Nagaenthran’s family—currently in Singapore thanks to crowdfunding efforts—have been told that they won’t be able to visit him and will only be allowed phone calls, according to a public statement by his sister, Sarmila K Dharmalinga.



”I am concerned about my brother Nagen. He has now tested positive for Covid and he will be alone. We are not sure how long he will be quarantined for in prison,” she said.



Anti-death penalty activist Kirsten Han questioned the Singaporean government’s reasoning.



“The absurdity of capital punishment is the state insisting someone of borderline intellectual functioning and cognitive impairment can be executed, [and] then the moment he tests Covid+ it’s suddenly about ‘logic, common sense and humanity’,” she wrote on Twitter.

“If the applicant has been afflicted by COVID-19… it's our view that the execution cannot take place anyway.”

Singapore has some of the harshest drug laws in the world. The government maintains that capital punishment is an effective deterrent against drug trafficking, while also claiming it receives strong support among the Singaporean public.

But the jarring details of Nagaenthran’s case have reignited fierce debate over the government’s continued use and defence of the death penalty.

On social media, many condemned the state’s decision to execute Nagaenthran. “Will killing this man make us feel safer at night? I don’t think so,” one wrote. Others called out the “cold and cruel” way news of the execution was delivered to Nagaenthran’s family in Ipoh, Malaysia. Earlier this month, Nagaenthran’s mother received a matter-of-fact letter outlining her son’s imminent execution, as well as stating that she’d have to navigate COVID-19 restrictions in order to see him one final time.

The case has attracted global attention from rights groups, overseas foreign delegations and even British billionaire Sir Richard Branson, who took to Twitter this week to voice his support for Nagaenthran, calling on Singapore’s president to spare his life.

“His ordeal exposes the fatal flaws of the death penalty on so many levels,” Branson wrote in a strongly-worded statement on Nov. 8."

They were aided by the fact that soon after receiving his shot, Newsom canceled plans to attend a climate summit in Scotland, citing unspecified family obligations. In a bit of an object lesson for how these things go, the governor’s office has only belatedly and partially responded to baseless speculation that he was actually dealing with a vaccine injury, allowing theories about his absence from the public eye to run truly—and usefully, for the people promoting them—wild.

Newsom received his shot on Wednesday, October 27; soon after, as the Associated Press reported on Saturday, he raised eyebrows by canceling a long-planned November 1 trip to Scotland to participate in a United Nations climate summit. Newsom’s office sent a press release October 29 saying he was dealing with family obligations, but provided no further information, and he wasn’t seen at any press conferences or public events for the remainder of the week, which is unusual for him. According to Vogue, Newsom did make a public appearance of sorts this past weekend, at the wedding of oil heiress Ivy Getty. Also over the weekend, Newsom’s wife Jennifer Siebel Newsom tweeted and quickly deleted a jab at his critics, which read, “It’s funny how certain folks can’t handle truth. When someone cancels something, maybe they’re just in the office working; maybe in their free time they’re at home with their family, at their kids’ sports matches, or dining out with their wife. Please stop hating and get a life.”

After publication, Newsom’s office told Motherboard in an email, “No, the Governor did not have any adverse reaction to his booster shot.” They added, in a statement attributed to press secretary Daniel Lopez, “Last week Governor Newsom worked in the Capitol with staff on urgent issues including COVID-19 vaccines for kids, boosters, ports, the forthcoming state budget and California’s continued economic recovery. He will have public events this week related to the economy and vaccines.”

His office released a video of him wishing a happy Diwali and Bandi Chhor Divas to his constituents on November 4, but it wasn’t until November 8 that Lopez, his press secretary, told the Mercury News “No events were canceled as a result of his booster shot.”

All of this was just enough for two, occasionally overlapping groups of people: Calfornia Republicans and COVID conspiracy theorists.

Republican officials—along with transparency advocates of all sorts—pointed out, fairly, that it’s actually good to know where the governor of a large state is. State Senator Melissa Melendez, a Republican and frequent Newsom critic, tweeted, “Governor Newsom has repeatedly assured [sic] that vaccines are safe. Given the rumors swirling around about the timing of his disappearance (right after getting the booster), I hope he emerges soon to explain his absence, and I hope that’s he’s healthy.” (Charges of hypocrisy are particularly charged for Newsom, who previously faced criticism for attending a now-infamous dinner with medical lobbyists at the French Laundry in November 2020. Photos of the event appeared to show that the event was indoors and that no one was wearing masks or social distancing, at a time when the Governor’s office was urging everyone to follow those protocols. Newsom’s office insisted the event had been outside.)

This came to an exhausting head Monday, when Children’s Health Defense, Robert F. Kennedy’s massive anti-vaccine organization, published a blog post claiming that an unspecified source “close to the Governor” had told them that Newsom’s symptoms “were similar to those associated with Guillain–Barré syndrome (GBS).” The post was not bylined and there is no particular reason to believe a single thing Children’s Health Defense has to say. A constellation of vaccine “skeptics” including Christiane Northrup, a former OB-GYN turned COVID conspiracy theorist and Larry Cook, a well-known anti-vax campaigner who used to run the largest anti-vaccine Facebook page in the country, nevertheless quickly shared the post.

As a clear—if perhaps overly subtle—proof of life, Newsom’s office announced that he would appear at an economic forum in Monterey on Tuesday, which organizers said would be broadcast via livestream. According to journalist Ashley Zavala, Newsom won’t be taking questions after the event."

Among other things, Rodgers said he’s taking ivermectin, a drug which has no proven use for treating COVID, on the advice of Joe Rogan.

“I found a long term immunization protocol to protect myself and I'm very proud of the research that went into that,” Rodgers also said, from home, while in quarantine, with COVID.

Rodgers previously claimed in a press conference he’d been “immunized” against COVID; after testing positive this week, NFL.com reported he’d received a homeopathic treatment, and had lobbied the NFL to be considered vaccinated based on that treatment. Rodgers declined on McAfee’s show to disclose exactly what the treatment involved, although it sounds an awful lot like bogus homeopathic “vaccines” called nosodes that have been making the rounds for a number of years. Homeopathy is not a real medical discipline and does not work to prevent COVID or anything else.

Rodgers told McAfee that his medical team presented the NFL with a “500 page report” on the supposed efficacy of the treatment or treatments he received. “They thought I was a quack,” he said. The protocol, he said, was developed in consultation with “amazing minds,” including “MDs, holistic doctors, different people” and was “a way to stimulate my immune system.” Vaccinations “stimulate” the immune system, and do so safely and effectively. Taking meaningless tinctures, sugar pills or raiding any other aisle at Whole Foods does not.

Rodgers claimed that he has an allergy to the mRNA vaccines, which, if true, would be an extremely rare medical condition, and decided not to get a Johnson and Johnson vaccine over concerns about blood clots, which are extremely rare and are believed to largely affect women of reproductive age.

“I have taken this very seriously,” he said. “I’m not a COVID denier or anything like that. I just wanted to make the decision that’s best for my body.”

Rodgers expressed concern that the “long term effects” of vaccines aren’t known, specifically around fertility, since he has a desire to become a father in the near future. There’s no proof COVID vaccines or any others cause infertility; a number of people, in fact, became pregnant during clinical trials for the vaccines, which suggest otherwise. Contracting COVID, on the other hand, may lead to infertility

Near the end of his time, Rodgers insisted that he was simply in favor of bodily autonomy, then veered almost immediately into suggesting that vaccines offer fewer benefits than “natural immunity,” another anti-vaccine talking point.

“Vaccines do offer some protection for sure but there’s a lot we don’t know about them, there’s a lot we don’t know about the waning antibody counts. There’s been conversations around boosters,” he said. What hasn’t been part of the conversation, he added, is natural immunity: “There’s 30 studies I can go through that talk about how important natural immunity is. If you’ve gotten covid and recovered that's the best boost to immunity you can have.” (The thing vaccine skeptics never seem quite clear on is that an Israeli study found that people who had covid and then got vaccinated have very strong protection against getting the disease again. Like vaccine-conferred immunity, we’re still not clear how long natural immunity lasts.)

Rodgers also said that he believed reporters were looking two months ago into his “immunization” comments, based on the way he phrased his response to the question. “I knew this was going to come, I was ready for it.”

That said, he insisted, “There was nothing deceptive about it… If there’d been follow-up questions I would have answered them.” His team, he said, “has known my status since day one.”"

Thousands of anti-vaccine mandate protestors gathered in New Zealand’s capital of Wellington on Tuesday, Nov. 9, blocking roads and rallying outside of the country’s Parliament to denounce state-enforced COVID-19 vaccination requirements and government lockdowns.

While it was a mostly peaceful protest, bizarre images from ground showed protesters wearing Donald Trump masks and waving Trump flags. Still others carried “Let’s Go Brandon” signs, an anti-Biden political slogan. Patched Mongrel Mob and other gang members were also part of the crowd, according to Stuff.

Despite the protest not having anything to do with America, the scene invoked the image of the January 6 attack on the United States Capitol, which saw thousands of Trump supporters storm the building to protest President Joe Biden’s election.

Disturbing reports of violence and threats emerged throughout the day, as a cameraman was allegedly grabbed and pushed by protesters in Wellington, who yelled anti-media abuse, and a police officer was allegedly bitten by a protester in Auckland. One New Zealander posted a photo on Twitter of tennis balls that they alleged were thrown onto Parliament – the words “Hang Ardern” scrawled on them in black marker.

The Parliament crowd consisted of an estimated 3,000 people, the majority of whom were brandishing signs and shouting slogans opposing vaccine mandates announced by Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern last month. Those mandates stipulated that teachers and health workers need to be fully vaccinated against COVID-19 and that 90 percent of the population needs to be inoculated before restrictions will end – a higher threshold than in most other countries.

Rallies condemning the laws, and COVID restrictions in general, also took place in other parts of New Zealand, including Auckland and Invercargill.

Many protesters called for freedom and demanded that the mandates be wound back. By late morning all the gates and entrance ways to Parliament were shut off, in what House Speaker Trevor Mallard said was the biggest increase in parliamentary security he had seen since his election in 1984. By mid-afternoon, the protests had wound down to just 100 people outside Parliament.

Addressing the media on Tuesday afternoon, Ardern said, “What we saw today was not representative of the vast bulk of New Zealanders.”

Unlike his friends, he didn’t have a physical copy or even a digital one saved on his phone.

But when he got to the venue, Dalaly slipped his hand under the scanner – much to the security guard’s surprise. In half a second, a green light blinked somewhere inside his skin, and the scanner threw up his vax details. Dalaly got in without ever having to rummage around for identification.

Dalaly describes himself as a “human cyborg,” quite like other individuals who’ve implanted themselves with microchips: grain-sized capsules that respond to data through signals called radio frequency identification (RFID).

“To me, it’s like having a sixth sense, which you can use to show your vaccine certificate, unlock doors, computers, make payments and share information,” he told VICE.

Dalaly first found out about humans getting microchip implants in 2014. He read about a company that was offering its employees the ability to convert their work badges into a scannable chip that could then be installed under their skin.

After mulling over it for more than six years, Dalaly finally took the decision to inject his very own RFID implant in June 2020, once the technology had gotten enough updates for a single microchip to perform multiple functions.

“I use my microchip to store my medical records and work portfolio, as well as to use it as a crypto wallet and to unlock doors,” he said.

RFID technology has been around for decades. It uses an antenna to send and receive radio waves that transmit information in a manner similar to a barcode scanner. British scientist Kevin Warwick (known by the moniker “Captain Cyborg”) was the very first person in the world to get an RFID implant back in 1998. This was part of an experiment to monitor and record his movements as he opened doors, and turned on lights and computers without lifting a finger.

Decades later, the technology has become commercially available. In fact, it’s fairly common in Sweden, where thousands of people have embraced the technology that opens doors and turns on light switches. With the pandemic increasing our interactions with tech more than ever, an increasing number of people are finding themselves intrigued by the idea of low-key turning their bodies into machines.

“I didn’t actually know anyone else who had such an implant,” said Dalaly. “So, I joined this Facebook group to speak to others who had also gotten these chips installed.”

RFID Implantees is an online community of more than 4,000 individuals who either have microchips embedded in them or are contemplating getting it.

The group, which requires people to request membership, aims to educate people interested in RFID implants about the many ways they can be coded, from functioning as security locks and car keys to convenient credit cards that can be scanned on demand. These subdermal implants are usually installed in the area between the thumb and the index finger using an injection, though some prefer surgical incisions to install it. While many members have only one microchip, some have more than 20.

Sandra Würthner, a travel blogger from Austria, currently has 25 such chips in her that make her life easier in multiple ways, from storing payment details to starting her car. In 2017, she became one of the first people in the world to inject an implant that could store payment information. For her, the convenience that comes with being a cyborg overshadows the negativity and toxic reactions she usually gets.

“I’ve always been a sci-fi fan and super into Star Trek, so it’s cool to feel like I have this technology inside me,” she told VICE.

But, for many, microchips also come loaded with unique codes that can be programmed to perform specific functions.

Jake Bachus, an ethical hacker from Michigan, USA, already had the usual implants to unlock doors and store information. But he saw that these inconspicuous implants had the potential to become the ultimate security solution.

“I built and programmed a regular implant to become the key to my gun safe,” he told VICE. For Bachus, a microchip inserted into his skin posed less of a threat than for people to access something as potentially dangerous as guns, especially since he has ADHD and often loses his keys or forgets passwords. So, he quite literally took matters into his own hands. “It is faster than a digital keypad, more reliable than biometrics, and more secure, since someone can see you punch in numbers in a keypad.”

For many self-proclaimed cyborgs, the added layer of security that comes from knowing their scannable codes are stored safely under their skin is a major factor that influences their decision. However, data privacy experts have previously expressed concerns about whether the microchips can be used to trace, hack or steal sensitive data by literally getting under a person’s skin.

In fact, the Council on Ethical and Judicial Affairs (CEJA) of the American Medical Association said in a 2007 report that RFID implants could lead to privacy concerns because, although information can’t be stored inside the RFID transponder, there was no assurance that the information in the chip was being protected properly.

However, tech enthusiasts continue to argue otherwise.

“It’s easier to track a person using their smartphone than it is through a microchip, which are passive devices and not powered by a battery, but instead, require the implants to be within 2-3 millimetres of the RFID reading device,” said Patrick Paumen. The Netherlands-based biohacker has more than 31 implants, many of which are meant to store passwords to his email and even his Wordpress website.

Many implantees say their microchips can only be accessed when someone is close enough to hold their hands, a risk many seem willing to take.

While these microchips are often a conversation starter for those implanted, many have also been on the receiving end of comments that question their very allegiance to humanity.

“We often get told that it’s the ‘mark of the beast,’ that it signals we have now been taken over by Satan,” said Dalaly. “I remember I was dating this girl, and when she took me home to meet her parents, her dad said that my microchip meant the ‘end of days’ were near, and even quoted a line from the Book of Revelations that referred to Satan’s mark.”

He added that given how relatively niche the space still is, the uncertainty and anxieties around inserting a technological object into your skin tend to elicit mixed responses. Others, like Würthner, admit to having lost multiple friends who questioned her many subdermal implants, arguing that they were dangerous. Implantees also often get asked whether their scannable chips ever get rejected, or what it’s like to walk through metal detectors at airports.

For many implantees, however, the biggest risk involved is redundancy, given that constant technological updates could render their RFID chips obsolete.

This is the case especially for Jack Kingsman, who feels that none of his three implants have been really useful. “One of my chips has a poor antenna, which outweighs any regular usefulness,” he admitted. “My other implant is a proximity card emulator that can be used to enter buildings or elevators, but sadly [it] no longer works due to a programming error shortly after I got it installed. So, I think I have some useless chips in me right now. But I've never been bothered to take them out since they’re body-compatible for the long term.”

Others have also admitted that the redundancy of magnetic implants, an experimental prototype that preceded the use of RFID implants, has led to concerns over whether the current microchip models can also stay useful over time.

But despite the potential dangers and drawbacks, this community continues to embrace their implants with pride, choosing to favour the convenience factor over an uncertain future.

“Humans are always hiding behind a device anyway, so why not get them installed inside [them] instead?” said Dalaly.

For many, the group has also become a space to bounce ideas off each other on all the intriguing ways their microchips can be coded, from a watch where numbers glow under the skin to a flash drive that can store all data subdermally.

“Unlike piercings and tattoos, these implants aren't designed to change your appearance, and instead, add practical uses to our bodies,” Paumen said. “Technology keeps evolving. We humans keep evolving. But for some of us, it isn't happening quick enough. So, we take matters – and implants – into our own hands. Literally.”"

The autopsy, performed by a retired college anatomy professor, included several hours of dissection: slicing into the chest cavity and removing organs and the brain.

Clark told KING5 that he passed the body to a private company called Med Ed Labs, which claimed to solicit corpses for medical research purposes. That company then sold the body to Jeremy Ciliberto, the founder of DeathScience.org, who partnered with the Oddities and Curiosities Expo to hold the cadaver autopsy event. Ciliberto said he bought bodies for this event for more than $10,000.

A representative for the Oddities and Curiosities Expo told Motherboard in an email that the expo’s only role in the event was to provide a ticketing platform for Death Science, and that the cadaver class has never been a part of the traveling expo.

“Oddities and Curiosities Expo was aware that this demonstration was happening at a different location with a different company, and were of the understanding that it was intended to be educational in nature,” the representative said.

Ciliberto advertised these events on his TikTok account.

People involved claimed that they were duped by the next person in the line-of-custody to take possession of Saunders’ body. Clark told KING5 he was under the impression that Med Ed Labs would use the corpse for medical research, and that “[Saunders] and his family thought that his body was going for the advancement of medical students.” Med Ed Labs claimed that Ciliberto was “beyond” dishonest about the nature of the event, and called it a “medical class.” Ciliberto claimed that the family was informed all along—“I can guarantee that that man knew his body would be used for medical research,"" Ciliberto said. Ciliberto pitched all along that it was an educational performance, and perhaps it was enlightening for the people who watched it.

In a statement to Motherboard, Ciliberto claimed that Med Ed Labs was responsible for and provided the cadaver as well as the anatomist, the equipment, a serology report, the venue booking, and all handling of the body before, during and after the event. “Med Ed Lab was contracted by Death Science and within this contract included confirmation that the provided cadaver was donated for research, medical and educational purposes,” Ciliberto said.

""In this workshop we will be observing a forensic autopsy on a full human cadaver. Death Science’s medical professionals will be guiding us through a formal autopsy. From the external body exam to the removal of vital organs including the brain, we will find new perspectives on how the human body can tell a story. There will be several opportunities for attendees to get an up close and personal look at the cadaver.

“Cadaver access before, after and during breaks,"" a description for the ""Autopsy class"" reads. The ""Dissection Class,"" meanwhile, which followed one hour after the conclusion of the Autopsy class, said ""we will be observing an anatomical dissection on a full human cadaver. Death Science’s medical professionals will be guiding us through a formal anatomical dissection. This dissection will offer us a unique look at what is under our skin, through our bodies and how it all works together. There will be several opportunities for attendees to get an up close and personal look at the cadaver.""

A recent article on the funeral directors news website Connecting Directors discussed so-called chain-of-custody issues, where bodies are misplaced, misidentified, or otherwise lost. “You have to know, without any hint of a doubt, from the moment the remains are placed into your care to the time they reach final disposition or are returned to the family, that you can positively, unequivocally, provide positive, proper identification of that individual,” the article states.

According to the National Association of Medical Examiners, since Medical Examiners and Coroners work in full personal protective equipment, and COVID-19 is spread through respiratory droplets when a person speaks, sneezes or coughs, the risk of catching it from a dead person is low. “There is little scientific concern about contracting COVID-19 while performing an autopsy in full PPE (surgical gown, face shield, N-95 mask, shoe covers, head cover, 3 pairs of gloves),” NAME said in a statement in 2020. “The risk of acquiring COVID-19 is greater in the community than in the autopsy room.”

Body donation is an unregulated industry. Donations to universities are most likely to be used for teaching and research, and donors are much-needed to develop new medicine and tools that help the living, but private, for-profit companies that buy and sell cadavers have been caught using them to test explosives or leaving them to thaw in the sun.

Another of the expo’s Seattle autopsy class, set for Halloween, was canceled following KING5’s report. “We feel that this was not respectful and certainly not ethical,” Kimberly DiLeo, the chief medical death investigator for the Multnomah County, Oregon Medical Examiner, told the outlet."

… [+3331 chars]",Left,"California Governor Gavin Newsom didn’t make public appearances for nearly two weeks after receiving a Moderna booster, and abruptly canceled his trip to COP26, a UN-led climate change conference.

The mystery around where Newsom was has launched a thousand conspiracy theories, with the governor saying he canceled his trip because of an unspecified “family obligation” that turned out to be Halloween. And just days after canceling his trip to one of the most important climate change conferences, he attended the lavish San Francisco wedding of billionaire oil heiress Ivy Getty, according to an event piece from Vogue.

Newsom was supposed to return from the conference a few days before the wedding, but the timing and optics couldn’t be worse from the governor who oversees the world’s fifth-largest economy and spent much of the year explaining why he attended a maskless dinner with donors at one of the country’s most expensive restaurants during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Newsom was set to attend COP26, which runs from October 31 to November 12, with plans to fly out on November 1. He cancelled the plans citing an unspecified “family obligation” on October 29 after receiving a COVID booster two days earlier. On Halloween, he was spotted dressed as a pirate trick-or-treating with his kids.

The governor blamed his children for making him miss the climate conference. “I had that dinner—a lot of you know this dinner with the family—and the kids literally, they kind of had an intervention, they said, they couldn’t believe that I was going to miss Halloween,” Newsom said Tuesday at the California Economic Summit in Monterey, his first public appearance in weeks. “I woke up that next morning with something that’s probably familiar to a lot of parents, that knot in your stomach, and I had no damn choice, I had to cancel that trip.”

The California delegation to COP26 returned from Scotland on Thursday, November 4. On Monday, November 8, the same day President Barack Obama was speaking at COP26, Newsom attended the wedding of Ivy Getty, an heiress to the Getty oil fortune. Founded in 1942 by J. Paul Getty, the Getty oil business exploded in the 20th century making the family one of the richest in the world. The company went bankrupt in 2011 and was sold to Lukoil, but the family still has a massive fortune.

The 26-year-old’s wedding was expensive and strange. Sen. Nancy Pelosi officiated and actress Anna Taylor-Joy was the maid of honor. She wore a haute couture dress of broken glass designed by famed Italian stylist John Galliano.

Newsom sat on the bride’s side of the aisle. The Newsom and Getty family have deep ties that go back a generation. Gavin’s father Bill Newsom was close friends with Gordon Getty, Ivy’s grandfather. Bill later managed the Getty family trust (valued at $2 billion) and was the bag man who handled the ransom money when John Paul Getty III was kidnapped in 1973.

According to The Los Angeles Times, 18 different Gettys have all contributed money to Newsom’s business ventures and political career. The total public contributions are around $516,925. Newsome grew up with the Gettys and Ann and Gordon Getty repeatedly said they considered Newsom a son.

Deep connections or not, skipping a massive conference about the climate crisis, one of the most pressing threats to the state you run, only to soon after attend the lavish wedding of an oil heiress is a bad look."

Former President Donald Trump endorsed Idaho Lt. Gov. Janice McGeachin on Tuesday night in a long-running battle with Idaho Republican Gov. Brad Little, calling her “a true supporter of MAGA since the very beginning,” in his latest move to put aggressively pro-Trump allies in charge of the GOP.

McGeachin isn’t just some run-of-the-mill MAGA backer, though. She has close ties to Eric Parker, the well-known leader of the Real Three Percent of Idaho, an offshoot of the Three Percenter militia movement. In June, she cheerily accepted an endorsement from Parker, who thanked her for pledging to be a “friend” to the movement if she wins the governorship.

Parker was dubbed “the Bundy Ranch sniper” and gained fame in the far-right “patriot movement” when he aimed his weapon at federal officers during the 2014 standoff at Ammon Bundy’s Nevada ranch. He later pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor for his role in that standoff but avoided serious jail time.

There’s a lot more: McGeachin spoke at a 2019 rally organized by militia leaders, swearing in an armed group with an oath paraphrased from the state constitution that seemed to push the views of the far-right sovereign citizen movement, has posed with militia members who were flashing the far-right “OK” hand signal, and has been involved in advocating for others who got longer sentences for their roles in the Bundy Ranch standoff to get out of jail. She’s also shown up to campaign events with a personal security detail that included one person with a visible III% tattoo (the symbol of the militia).

She’s also pushed COVID-19 denialism, appearing in an October 2020 video from the libertarian Idaho Freedom Foundation that said the pandemic “may or may not be occurring.”

McGeachin has also engaged in a wild tug-of-war with Little. Every time he’s left the state, she’s issued bizarre executive orders, including one that banned all mask mandates in the state, including prohibitions on school mask mandates, as well as a directive to send Idaho’s national guardsmen to the U.S.-Mexico border and an outright ban on all mandatory COVID testing in the state. Little has reversed those executive orders each time he’s returned.

McGeachin celebrated Trump’s endorsement on Twitter, promising there was “much more to come from the two of us”:

Little has yet to announce he’s running for reelection, but is widely expected to run. And unlike some other Republicans that Trump has gone after, Little has been careful not to antagonize the former president. Trump even praised him as a “terrific gentleman” in a speech last week, making his support for McGeachin even stranger.

The endorsement is Trump’s latest aggressive attempt to remake the Republican Party in his image and make sure only the most aggressively pro-Trump Republicans hold positions of power."

A government call to stockpile food has led some Chinese people to believe a full-on war with Taiwan is coming, as people bought extra groceries, hardtack, and flashlights to prepare for a nasty battle that could drag the United States into conflicts should it actually happen.

China’s Ministry of Commerce on Tuesday encouraged families to stockpile essential supplies, prompting panic-buying across the country. People have speculated that authorities were anticipating a shortage of food during winter time or prolonged city lockdowns as the authorities try to keep COVID-19 numbers at zero.

But many others were convinced that the Chinese military would soon invade Taiwan and bring the island, which Beijing claims to be its own territory, under Communist Party rule.

“Taking Taiwan might only take half a day to one day, maximum three to five days,” a resident in the central city of Zhengzhou, who only gave his surname Wang, told VICE World News. “But if foreign hostile forces place a blockade against our country, the goods would not be able to enter China, and prices would go up.”

The frantic response reflects the increasingly fraught relationship between people on the two sides of the Taiwan Strait. Beijing’s propaganda on making Taiwan part of China and achieving “national rejuvenation” has fueled talk of war among its people, and authorities sometimes struggle to rein in rumors about an upcoming invasion.

Tensions in the Taiwan Strait have in the past months received intense media coverage in and outside of China. The Chinese military last month sent a record number of fighter jets to Taiwan’s air defence zone. Taiwanese President Tsai Ing-wen recently confirmed U.S. troops’ presence on the island, while a top U.S. general said this week that Washington could “absolutely” defend Taiwan, although he did not expect an attack in the next two years.

Wang, a 30-year-old home appliance salesman, said he had in the past few months spent more than 1,000 Chinese yuan ($156) putting together an emergency kit that included a multifunctional shovel, a compass, a gas mask, a fire starter, a whistle, and a fire extinguisher.

Wang said he also recently bulk-bought rice, flour, and cooking oil that would feed his family of eight through spring. He said the supplies would be needed in the case of an economic crisis or a war over Taiwan. Although Zhengzhou was some 800 miles away from the Taiwan Strait, Wang said it was a transportation hub and a potential target for enemy forces.

Wang said his family, living right next to a railway station, could be vulnerable. “If the city was partly or fully damaged in a war, you would have no choice but to move into the mountains, and you would need these devices,” he said.

People like Wang said the pro-unification rhetoric promoted by state media suggested a war could be imminent. Last week, a Chinese official in charge of Taiwan affairs said the island’s revenues would be used on improving livelihoods after unification, a comment that trended on the microblogging site. Nationalistic accounts have also promoted news that the Taiwanese defense ministry is drafting a war survival handbook.

This week, people have shared a viral article telling Chinese people where to invest in properties in Taiwan after the island became China’s “Taiwan province.” A city in eastern China handed out defense emergency kits to some residents. A fabricated text message asking reservists to be prepared for a draft was also widely circulating in chat groups.

These posts have prompted nationalistic cheering but also chatter about potentially disastrous conflicts. On Tuesday, “hardtack” was listed as a hot search term on shopping site Taobao, and many social media users said their elderly parents had purchased extra supplies just in case.

“Is our country really going to take Taiwan?” a Weibo user wrote on Tuesday. “My auntie has called my mom to stock up on rice together.”

Authorities later tried to quash the rumors. A social media outlet affiliated with China’s People’s Liberation Army, Junzhengping, on Wednesday warned the soldier mobilization rumors could mislead the public and bring “unpredictable consequences.”

State media have asked citizens not to read too much into the Ministry of Commerce’s stockpile call, which was aimed at preparing people for COVID-19 lockdowns. The ministry also stressed that China’s food supply was sufficient.

Wen-Ti Sung, a Taiwan expert with the Australian National University, said Chinese state media had been using such unification calls to drum up support for the Communist leadership in the mainland, without explicit mention of a military invasion.

“They are doing it tactically with plausible deniability,” Sung told VICE World News. “They talk about what’s going to happen after unification. So for some, it may sound like unification is happening soon, and we should rally behind our commander-in-chief, and that it’s time for unity internally rather than dissent or diversity.”

The public in Taiwan were in general not too alarmed by the recent spats, Sung said. Taiwanese people have been living under risk of war since the Communist Party came to power in the mainland in 1949 to form the People’s Republic of China, and forced the Republic of China government to move to Taipei. A recent poll suggested 64 percent of Taiwanese adults did not think a war was possible, while about one in four respondents believed Beijing would invade “sooner or later.”"

A Ukrainian intelligence service published a series of what it said are intercepted conversations between two hackers working for Russia’s Federal Security Service, or FSB.

Ukraine’s Security Service published the conversations on its official YouTube channel on Thursday. The video purportedly shows several conversations—labelled as “episodes”—between two FSB counterintelligence agents in Crimea, Mykola Serhiiovych Chernyk and Oleksandr Mykolaiovich Skilianko.

Some of them are mundane, such as a brief discussion on COVID tests and salaries, bonuses, and a “dress reimbursement.” Others specifically refer to hacking operations against Ukrainian government bodies.

“While he is still online, we are able to steal this crypto container from him,” Chernyk says, referring to an incident in which the hackers developed unique code to steal data, according to the video.

In another “episode,” Chernik tells Skilanko that “at this very moment I’m stealing (the data) from his drives.”

“There’s a couple of interesting things here,” Skilianko responds.

Ukraine’s authorities routinely post videos of operations where they arrest ransomware hackers, but it’s notable that it doxed and shared recorded conversations between counterintelligence agents working for another government. Ukrainian spies are effectively sending a message to its counterparts in Russia: not only we know what you are doing, but we can literally hear what you say.

Ukraine’s Security Service and the Russian embassy in Washington D.C. did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

In the last few years, Russia and Ukraine have been clashing on the border near the city of Donetsk. They also have been fighting online, with alleged Russian government hackers turning off the lights in some regions of Ukraine on two different occasions, as well as launching a destructive cyberattack that spilled all over the world."

A robo-voice thanked me for my patience, then promptly put me on hold again. I hung up.

From October 29 until November 1, American Airlines canceled more than 2,300 flights across the country, including mine, due to bad weather at its Dallas hub and, more importantly, serious staffing issues. The same weekend, Southwest Airlines canceled around 1,800 flights for the same reasons. These mass cancellations are being touted as a harbinger of shitty holiday travel, which is probably true. But they’re also glaring examples of what happens when industry giants with basically zero competition—like American and Southwest—get to fuck over consumers and workers with impunity.

Everything in the Air Travel Extended Universe already sucks at baseline. A typical trip to the airport involves shoelessness, $16 cocktails, and the humiliating powerplay of deciding when to stand up and get in line to board the plane. Having a flight canceled or delayed adds the secret sauce of personal crisis to an already unpleasant experience. And getting a flight delayed en masse means that not only are you in personal crisis—you’re surrounded by people in personal crisis, getting ready to pass on their anxiety to workers rendered powerless by the scale of the problem. Delays and cancellations create, in technical terms, a “bad vibe” in the terminal.

Advertisement

Why is this bad vibe allowed to run rampant through our nation’s airports? Because four giant companies (United, American, Southwest, and Delta) control the vast majority of air travel. They’re able to upcharge at will, hike up ticket prices, halt service to smaller airports, and generally suck ass without worrying about people flying elsewhere. In fact, they make more money when we’re miserable. According to Vox, “airlines collected $8.6 billion in baggage and change fees in 2019, six times the $1.4 billion they collected in 2007.”

One of the most painful aspects of the canceled flight experience is that, at first, you still have the illusion of control. When we first stepped in line, gossip snaked through the queue as people traded tidbits of information about what was happening. By hour three, most people were sitting on the floor or on top of their suitcases, silent and deflated. As we inched forward, I asked my boyfriend if I should tell the person behind the American Airlines counter that we needed to get on a flight ASAP because “my sister is about to give birth.” (I don’t have a sister.) Morale was abysmal. By the time we actually got to the counter (again, the exact same time I got my automated callback), we were willing to take whatever American had available just to get out of the airport and away from the looping airport soundtrack of Phoenix government officials alternately welcoming us to sunny Arizona and wishing us safe travels.

What American Airlines was willing to give us were vouchers, for one night in a hotel, a taxi ride to and from the airport, and two $12 meal credits—baller alert! We discovered the actual value of these slips of paper as soon as we left the airport. Our taxi driver, who had told us on our ride over that he’d been driving in Phoenix for 18 years, pretended not to know what an airline voucher was. Our hotel’s restaurants were closed by the time we checked in, so we couldn’t get a midnight dinner with our food vouchers. And our hotel voucher was good for the night, but we had to go back to the airport after a noon check-out to re-up for night two.

On our second day at the airport, the lines were shorter—although we did wait long enough for me to attend a full work meeting on Google Hangouts. Experiencing an airport line in front of my colleagues was marginally better than experiencing the airport line raw. For our troubles, we were booked into a different hotel in a different town, which meant we had to go back to Hotel One, get our luggage, and ferry it to Hotel Two while trying to spend as little actual money as possible. The whole ordeal took another three hours.

Almost everyone we spoke to over the course of two delay days, American Airlines employee or otherwise, was professional and relatively sympathetic. They were also visibly stressed out by the influx of displaced, tired people brandishing slips of paper or QR codes. That stress, accumulated over time, is how American Airlines found itself in this situation in the first place. Overworked airline employees on COVID leave left last weekend’s airplanes short-staffed, which turned a regional weather event (high winds in Texas) into a national holdup. And why should anyone rush back from PTO to a job that places them at the forefront of enforcing in-flight COVID safety measures or shifts the burden of managing and maintaining complex schedules directly onto their plate while they simultaneously fly a fucking airplane?

For me, it wasn’t all bad. I got to post a picture of myself sitting by a pool on my Instagram story (suffering is not a part of my personal brand) and watch Godzilla vs. Kong on a small screen next to a guy in a Supreme shirt. I returned home to my apartment in Brooklyn two days later than planned and two days of work behind, my Tuesday consumed by a pair of flights that (thank GOD) went as planned. A week later, I’m mostly caught up on work and generally recovered from the nightmarish experience of staying in a room that has Showtime access but not HGTV."

Adding a touch of irony to events was a very public pilgrimage the official had led to Karl Marx’s grave in London just prior.



Serving as Vietnam’s Minister of Public Security, To Lam was leading a delegation at the COP26 climate summit held in Glasgow, Scotland this month. Back in London on Nov. 2, the group posed for photos at the grave of “The Father of Communism”, laying wreaths and paying their respects, according to Vietnamese state media.

The controversial video, posted to the celebrity chef’s 11 million TikTok followers on Nov. 3, showed the Vietnamese delegation feasting on meat believed to cost up to $2,000 at Salt Bae’s—real name Nusret Gokce—restaurant Nusr-e.

In the one-minute clip, platters of gold-leaf steak are seen served up to the delegates’ table, tended to by Salt Bae himself. In true Salt Bae style, the celebrity chef puts on a performance—theatrically slicing the meat and sprinkling salt in his signature style. Using a steak knife, he picks up a slab of gold covered meat and hand-feeds To Lam. The Vietnamese official gives his approval with a thumbs up.

The irony of the scenes were lost on few, with footage of the controversial dining experience quickly spreading across TikTok, Facebook and Twitter, even after the original was pulled down.

Who paid for the meal and how much it cost remains unknown, with prices not listed on Nusr-e’s website. But given Salt Bae’s reputation for extravagance, as well as an eye-watering bill that surfaced online from the London restaurant last month, the cost likely ran into the thousands. As a minister, To Lam’s official wage is $600 to $800 a month.

Vietnamese human rights activist Hoang Dung was part of a wave of social media criticism emanating from the socialist country, struggling with rising poverty and hunger amid a surge in COVID-19 infections this year. Hoang denounced the opulent meal and questioned why a work event, potentially paid for by taxpayer money, was held at such an expensive restaurant.

The celebrity chef rose to internet fame after his distinctive method for seasoning meat became a meme. This isn’t the first time a communist official has faced criticism for enjoying an extravagant banquet at one of Gokce’s establishments, with Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro generating controversy when he dined at his restaurant in Turkey in 2018 at a time when three quarters of the country was living in extreme poverty.

Vietnamese officials are yet to comment on the criticism."

They were rushed to a hospital where they were declared dead on arrival. The incident took place as celebrations for Muqaddas’ wedding were underway, shortly before the arrival of the groom and his family.

According to police, Muqaddas and Adnan had been in love and were hoping to marry each other, but Muqaddas’ parents rejected the match and fixed her marriage to a suitor of their choice.

In traditional Pakistani culture, arranged marriages between couples are commonplace. Some families fix marriages between couples based on factors such as class, ethnicity, religion and socio-economic status. However, shifting patterns of education and media exposure in urban and rural settings have led to young people increasingly wanting to choose their own partners.

Despite this, many are still forced to fulfill familial obligations and continue to follow traditional marriage practices. According to a 2019 Gallup Pakistan survey, 85 percent of Pakistanis reported to have met their spouse through arranged marriage, while just 5 percent reported to have married for love.

“Marriages should require emotional compatibility, which is a very basic thing that is everyone's right. The couple should first and foremost like each other,” Islamabad-based psychiatrist Abdul Wahab Yousafzai told VICE World News. “You will prominently find that marriage in our society is itself a risk factor for poor mental health.”

In 2016, a similar case occurred in which a young couple ended their lives by ingesting poison in the city of Sargodha, after their union was rejected by their parents. In 2017, in the city of Gujranwala, a young unmarried couple jumped in front of a moving train.

According to Yousafzai, fictional stories such as Romeo and Juliet and similar Pakistani folk stories such as Heer Ranjha coupled with sensationalised and simplistic media coverage of suicide can increase vulnerability among young, impressionable people.

“Attributing suicide to just love affairs and fairy tales is indirect glamourisation. When people are constantly exposed to news reports that state things like ‘so-and-so left this world after being spurned in their love affair’ – this can be very dangerous,” said Yousafzai.

Since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, prolonged lockdowns, increasing unemployment and financial hardships have been linked to rising suicide rates in Pakistan. In 2020, the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan documented 1,735 deaths by suicide, out of which 1,086 were men and 649 were women. Many cases, however, escape detection as the country does not have an official suicide registry.

Suicide remains a crime in the country. People who survive suicide attempts may be punished with fines and, possibly, imprisonment.

“Over time, poor mental health, minimal coping strategies, indidvidual personality factors and social difficulties culminate, which can eventually lead people to becoming more vulnerable to death by suicide,” said Yousafzai.

In October, the infamous ransomware gang known as Conti released thousands of files stolen from the UK jewelry store Graff.

Now, the hackers would like the world to know that they regret their decision, perhaps in part because they released files belonging to very powerful people.

Among the data Conti leaked, there were sensitive files belonging to celebrities like David Beckham, Oprah Winfrey, and Donald Trump, according to The Daily Mail. There was also, according to the hackers themselves, information belonging to the UAE, Qatar, and Saudi royal families.

And the hackers really don’t want to piss them off.

“We found that our sample data was not properly reviewed before being uploaded to the blog,” the hackers wrote in an announcement published on Thursday. “Conti guarantees that any information pertaining to members of Saudi Arabia, UAE, and Qatar families will be deleted without any exposure and review.”

“Our Team apologizes to His Royal Highness Prince Mohammed bin Salman and any other members of the Royal Families whose names were mentioned in the publication for any inconvenience,” the hackers added.

The hackers also said that other than publishing the data on their site, they did not sell it or trade, and that from now on they will “implement a more rigid data review process for any future operations.”

Conti did not immediately respond to a request for comment sent via its official site.

Allan Liska, a researcher at cybersecurity firm Recorded Future who tracks ransomware, said that the hackers must have gotten scared of potential retaliation from the Arab states.

“Bluntly, UAE sends assassination teams to deal with people they don’t like. The US and UK don’t do that (any more). Even ransomware groups are subject to political pressure. My guess is that they had a conversation with someone in the Kremlin who told that this was a bad idea and so they removed the data,” Liska told Motherboard in an online chat. “This is their way of covering it up.”

But Brett Callow, a researcher who focuses on ransomware at Emsisoft, is not so sure.

“The nutso ramblings of a drunk? Either that or a statement intended to confuse and obfuscate. Smoke and mirrors. Some analysts have speculated that the apology is the result of pressure from the Russian government, but that seems unlikely,” he told Motherboard in an email. “A public apology like this would simply cause further embarrassment to the individuals it names. Also, Conti has hit Saudi-based companies in the past, so obviously has no problems operating in that part of the world.”

The hackers, in any case, said they will continue to publish data obtained from Graff, especially “as much Graff's information a possible regarding the financial declarations made by the US-UK-EU Neo-liberal plutocracy, which engages in obnoxiously expensive purchases when their nations are crumbling under the economic crisis, unemployment, and COVID.”"

The Spotsylvania County School Board voted 6–0 to remove “objectionable” materials from Riverbend High School’s library, after parents complained about LGBTQIA content available on the school’s digital library app. The vote happened at a contentious November 8 school board meeting. The news was first reported by the Fredericksburg Free Lance-Star.

During that board meeting, the mother of a student complained that the LGBTQ books section was too prominent in the app, which is essentially a search tool for books available in the high school’s library. The woman said she was on the app “by accident” and that it is “pushing all the kids in that direction,” and that the book Call Me By Your Name was inappropriate for high schoolers. She also cites 33 Snowfish, a book about homelessless, survival sex work, and abuse, as being inappropriate for minors.

“There are some bad, evil-related material that we have to be careful of and look at”

The woman also said in the meeting that there are 16 results in the app for “pedophilia,” which elicits a gasp from the audience. A search for “Jesus” returns 19 results, she says, “but half of them are about Muslims.” She says there are “CRT,” meaning “critical race theory,” books in the library that are “anti-police.” When she’s finished speaking, several board members interrupt the meeting with a motion to ban the books on the spot—without establishing what, exactly, they are banning. The meeting was stopped for about 10 minutes while the board discussed what steps they would need to take to suspend the meeting’s established agenda in order to take immediate action about these books; eventually they decided to handle it at the end of the meeting, above the objections of several board members who said it was an urgent matter that needed to be dealt with immediately.

Before the vote, school board representative Kirk Twigg said that they should keep the books “in the back, so parents can see that we are doing something about this, we are eradicating a problem area that has much complacency and problem at the administrative level.”

“I don’t think we should even see them, I think they should be thrown in a fire,” another school board member, Rabih Abuismail replied. He also said that public schools “would rather have our kids reading gay pornography than about Christ.”

“Let's go back to the basics of math, english, and history rather than pedophilia in our schools,"" he added.

The board voted to start removing books before a screening criteria was established.

School board meetings have become the chosen platform for communities to air their wildest culture-war theories: in the last few months alone, there has been violence against staff during discussions about mask mandates and the COVID-19 pandemic in schools, and one board moved their meetings entirely online after community members became too unruly to meet in person.

Libraries, too, have long been a frontline for battles between community members who want to see “explicit” books banned, and librarians who are attempting to serve communities without censorship. One such case, at the Loudoun County, Virginia public library in 1998, set a legal precedent when a judge deemed the installation of internet filters that banned sexually explicit websites as unconstitutional."

It seems that (((dog-whistles))) are just too subtle for modern politics.

Ohio GOP Senate candidate Mark Pukita defended his blatantly antisemitic ad attacking Republican primary front-runner Josh Mandel’s Jewish faith during a Thursday candidate forum.

“Are we seriously supposed to believe the most Christian-values Senate candidate is Jewish?” asks an actor in a radio ad Pukita has recently been airing. “I am so sick of these phony caricatures.”

Pukita doubled down when asked by a moderator to respond to claims the ad is “antisemitic and intentionally divisive and inflammatory.”

""In terms of antisemitism, all I did in an ad was pointed out that Josh is going around saying he's got the Bible in one hand and the Constitution in the other. But he's Jewish,” Pukita said, according to Politico. “Everybody should know that though, right?”

Mandel fired back at the attack in a Friday tweet. “Opponents attack me because I’m a proud American and a proud Jew,” he said.

Pukita, an IT consultant, is barely registering in the polls. Mandel, a former Ohio state treasurer who’s repeatedly run for statewide office, has had the early lead, with author and entrepreneur J.D. Vance, former Ohio Republican Party Chair Jane Timkin, and businessmen Bernie Moreno and Mike Gibbons as the other more serious candidates in the race.

Moreno, who spoke next at the forum, slammed Pukita’s comments.

“Josh, nobody should question your faith. That's not right,” Moreno said. “The Jewish religion, the Bible is the Bible. That was hard to hear. I'm sorry about that. That's not right. We're better than that, guys.”

Mandel hasn’t exactly been high on respecting the values of other faiths (or of secular people) during his current Senate run either. He’s campaigned hard on “Judeo-Christian” values and attacked Islam in an effort to ingratiate himself with the states large Evangelical conservative community.

“There’s no such thing as separation of church and state,” he declared at a recent Senate debate, arguing that the “Judeo-Christian ethic separates itself from Islam and atheism and all these other belief sets on so many levels, but one of the main levels is our acknowledgment of good vs. evil.”

“They’re trying to take god out of all aspects of society and they’re trying to water down on the Judeo-Christian bedrock of America,” he continued. “And my personal feeling is we shouldn’t be watering down, we should be doubling down. We should be instilling faith in the classroom, in the workplace, and everywhere in society.”

Mandel has also compared Afghan refugees fleeing the Taliban to reptiles, saying “You can keep feeding the alligators, but eventually you will be eaten as well,” and repeatedly claimed the refugees are bringing in “child brides” and COVID-19.

In October, he called for the government to shut down public schools and instead fund Christian and Jewish religious schools:

After running as an establishment-minded conservative in past elections, Mandel has pivoted hard to the right in his current race. The candidate has repeatedly used inflammatory rhetoric, claimed former President Donald Trump had the 2020 election stolen from him, and endorsed Georgia Republican Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, who has made a string of anti-Semitic comments herself.

Mandel has faced criticism from more liberal Jews for this pivot. But he’s fired back against claims he’s seeking to distance himself from his faith:"

Not far away, tourists take photos of mounted guards outside Admiralty House, and activists stage small protests near the gates of Downing Street.

It’s here, just round the corner from the Prime Minister’s official residence, that Richard Ratcliffe is on a hunger strike fighting for the freedom of his wife. Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe, a 42-year-old British Iranian citizen and charity worker, was imprisoned in 2016 under charges of, “plotting to topple the Iranian government,” which her supporters vehemently deny. After years in the notorious Evin prison for political prisoners, she was temporarily released in 2020 because of the COVID pandemic and has remained under house arrest since then, despite new charges against her and the threat of reimprisonment. For five years, Zaghari-Ratcliffe has faced gruelling circumstances in an Iranian jail, away from her husband, her home, and their young daughter Gabriella – now 6 – over a kafkaesque international disagreement.

Ratcliffe has spent the last 19 days on hunger strike outside the UK’s Foreign Office. To say he seems tired is an understatement. His face is ruddy from the cold and lack of food, and he speaks softly, so much so I worry the recorder won’t pick him up.

“I'm knackered at this point,” he tells VICE World News, sat on a camping chair, surrounded by messages of support and a lightboard that reads, “HUNGER FOR JUSTICE DAY 19.” “This has been quite a full-on day. My body is probably getting a bit creaky now. We just had a fairly intensive meeting with ministers which didn't go well.”

Ratcliffe had just come from a meeting inside the Foreign Office to speak to Middle East minister James Cleverly. After the talk, he told supporters and press that the meeting had been “depressing.” It seemed like after 19 days, little progress had been made.

“In terms of what we got told? Not much,” Ratcliffe said after the meeting. “[Cleverly] couldn't give a timeline of when things were going to move forward. We asked about diplomatic protection and what they were willing to do with it. They didn’t have anything to say. We asked about the debt, and they wouldn’t talk about it and really clammed up.”

Zaghari-Ratcliffe’s continued imprisonment has become linked to a decades-old debt the UK owes to Iran from the 1970s after it failed to deliver an order of military tanks before the Shah was toppled. The issue of why the UK hasn’t paid the debt it owes is one shrouded in mystery – so much that it wasn’t until 2020 that the UK government even acknowledged it. Despite an international arbitration process in 2008 which ruled that the UK must pay the money, little has been done to pay back the four-decade-old £400 million debt. As time passes and ministers obfuscate, Zaghari-Ratcliffe spends another day away from her family and freedom.

After Ratcliffe’s meeting, he is clearly disheartened. “I told [ministers] I just don't hear any hope. I don't hear any strategy that is going to stop [Iran] playing games.”

What is motivating Ratcliffe through this exhausting strike? “To push the government to change its path,” he says. “My job is to protect Nazanin. She was threatened with imprisonment. It felt like by being here we prevented that for a bit. I think we have. Nothing's happened on that case. No phone call has come from the prison saying ‘come in.’”

For now, Zaghari-Ratcliffe remains on house arrest, with the risk of reimprisonment on the horizon. “I feel there's greater understanding of the position there was before but as today's meeting showed, we didn't make further progress than that,” Ratcliffe says.

The couple’s story is a heartbreaking one about the human cost of diplomatic tensions. Ratcliffe will continue his hunger strike until Friday, but due to health implications he is likely to end it soon. Facing disappointment from Nazanin and his daughter, who barely understands what’s happening according to Ratcliffe, it’s a difficult position to face after so many days without food, and so many years fighting for the safety of his wife.

“I'm not sure [what's next],” says Ratcliffe “This is a short term tactic, I have to stop it quite soon. There's so much lovely support we've received – it's really moving. Once we stop this and recover, we need to learn how to channel that care to keep the government honest.”"

Democrats just took a shellacking in last night’s elections, in a warning sign of the stiff headwinds they face heading into the 2022 midterms.

Republican Glenn Youngkin won Virginia’s hotly contested gubernatorial election, the first time the GOP has won that governorship since 2009, and part of a Republican sweep of the commonwealth’s statewide offices. New Jersey’s gubernatorial race is still too close to call, when Democrats were confident they’d win. And Republicans swept Pennsylvania’s statewide judicial elections, including a victory for a Supreme Court seat in the key swing state.

It’s not just the statewide offices that should have Democrats nervous. They also were defeated in a number of local races on Long Island, New York.

The overall results show that Republicans are pissed off, turning out in huge numbers, and on the march heading into the 2022 midterms as they seek to take back the House, the Senate, and a bevy of governorships and other offices around the country.

Virginia’s election was the most closely watched of the night—and Youngkin’s win came after he ran hard on critical race theory and schools issues while separating himself from former President Donald Trump, who remains unpopular with swing voters in the commonwealth.

Democrats immediately began infighting, with progressives and centrists blaming each other for the election results. Some in both wings of the party sought to tie Democrats’ bad night with their ongoing struggles to pass major legislation through Congress. National frustrations with the impact of the COVID-19 Delta surge, supply-chain problems, and rising prices likely played a role in these races too.

But the results from other states show that it’s silly to focus on the particular details of one race. And while various beltway Democrats are already arguing the losses show their party must do exactly what they’ve been advocating all along on specific policies, those claims should be taken with a mountain of salt. New Jersey Republican nominee Jack Ciattarelli’s biggest issue was property taxes. The Long Island races, if they turned on anything, turned on bail reform. The national environment simply is a brutal one for Democrats, with a fired-up GOP base and unhappy independent voters combining for a tidal wave that high turnout on the left simply can’t block. What really matters: President Biden’s polling numbers are abysmal right now, Republicans are fired up, and independents aren’t happy with the president or his party.

Turnout was sky-high in New Jersey and Virginia. Murphy won a 14-point blowout four years ago with slightly more than 1.2 million votes; this year, he’s almost at that number with 85% of the vote counted but led by just 6,000 total votes. Republicans saw an incredible surge in turnout, from fewer than 900,000 votes in 2017 to at least 1.2 million this year.

Virginia was the same. With 99% of the vote counted, McAuliffe received more than 1.6 million votes—200,000 more than Democratic Gov. Ralph Northam won four years ago in his 9-point blowout victory. But Youngkin won almost 1.7 million votes—up from the 1.2 million votes that Republican Ed Gillespie won in 2017.

The turnout surge was especially high in rural, conservative areas, where Democrats fell to new lows in a bevy of counties that they simply couldn’t offset with strong voter turnout elsewhere.

Still, governor’s races generally aren’t as good of a barometer of the national mood as federal races, because they more often turn on local issues. Democrats’ gubernatorial victories in Kentucky and Louisiana in 2019 didn’t say much about where the 2020 elections were heading in those states, for instance.

And Youngkin and Ciattarelli managed to find enough space from Trump to run their own campaigns—both weren’t nearly as Trumpy as other GOP candidates running in their primaries. Top GOP candidates in many other states aren’t even trying to do that, and could cost them suburban votes.

But Virginia has long been a strong barometer for the national political mood—and combined with Tuesday’s other results, Democrats should be alarmed.

The party that sits in the White House has lost all but one of Virginia’s gubernatorial races in the last half-century—and almost always faces fierce headwinds in a president’s first midterm. The results of the GOP’s strong 2009 and 2013 elections foreshadowed brutal midterms for President Obama’s party, just as Democrats’ big wins in 2017 presaged the 2018 blue wave."

“A man of determination and action, a man of profound thoughts and feelings, a man who inherited a legacy but dares to innovate, and a man who has forward-looking vision and is committed to working tirelessly.” This is how China’s propaganda apparatus would like you to view the country’s paramount ruler, Xi Jinping.

That glowing description was taken from an extraordinary profile of the Chinese president, as state media writers extol the virtues and achievements of Xi just before a key meeting that is expected to cement the powerful leader’s status as a guardian of the nation for years, or even decades, to come.

Advertisement

The biography, published by the state-run Xinhua news agency on Saturday in at least ten languages, sings the praises of Xi’s work, personality, and even physical strength. The authors portrayed Xi as a flawless man who has devoted his entire life to serving not only the Chinese people but also humankind as a whole.

“Xi is undoubtedly the core figure in charting the course of history,” the article declared.

Xi has emerged as China’s most powerful leader in decades ever since he came to power in 2012. With China’s influence expanding globally, his political campaigns at home and assertive foreign policies have won genuine support from Chinese people, some of whom have affectionately called the leader “Daddy Xi.”

In the meantime, the state’s increasing control over free speech and civil society has silenced dissent, reinforcing Xi’s image as the most capable and beloved figure to lead China since the deaths of Mao Zedong and Deng Xiaoping. With no successor in sight and a two-term presidential term limit abolished, Xi is poised to stay in power beyond 2023.

A Communist Party leadership meeting this week is a key juncture in making that happen, as officials review a monumental “historical resolution” on the party’s experiences in its past 100 years. With an authoritative retelling of Chinese history, the document is expected to make a case that China is in need of a strongman, long-lasting leader, and that Xi, with his touted superior qualities and track record, is best suited to be that man.

Dali Yang, a political scientist with the University of Chicago, said the glorifying profile was a capstone piece of a propaganda campaign orchestrated to build up Xi’s prestige and pave the way for Xi to potentially rule for a historic third term.

The profile depicted Xi as a father-like figure that protects his people from foreign enemies and, with his wisdom and determination, leads them onto “national rejuvenation.”

With six chapters chronicling Xi’s upbringing and political career, it attributed everything Beijing has accomplished since 2012 to Xi himself, from combating corruption to responding to Donald Trump’s trade war to cracking down on Hong Kong’s anti-government unrest. Not a single other incumbent leader’s name was mentioned.

The article mentioned how Xi “had a sleepless night” on the Chinese New Year’s Eve in 2020, after COVID-19 outbreaks were reported in the central city of Wuhan. Xi’s schedule was so tight that he had to spend a birthday during an overseas tour, the article said. Despite having little time for himself, the leader had managed to find time for swimming so he would have “enough stamina” for governance, it said.

When Xi was serving as a local party leader in a southeastern town, the profile said, he ate canteen food just like other cadres, and never summoned government vehicles for his wife’s use.

“It gets put together, basically to say ‘Look, this is our leader,’” Yang said. “And in some ways it implicitly says ‘he deserves to be our leader in the future as well.’”

The profile also quoted foreign scholars and politicians in complimenting Xi’s governance and popularity, at the expense of accuracy.

Neil Thomas, an analyst with Eurasia Group, was quoted in the profile as saying Xi was enjoying greater support within the party. But he said the quote, pulled from his analysis on the number of “yes” votes in Chinese parliament, was taken out of context, since it was impossible to tell if the declining expression of dissent reflects genuine support for the leader.

Thomas said the quotes from foreign experts, including himself, were included to bolster the legitimacy of Chinese state media propaganda.

“The intended audience for a profile like this is both party members and cadres and leaders, to demonstrate to them that Xi Jinping remains in this powerful position,” Thomas told VICE World News. “Because in this closed political system, you need to keep demonstrating your power and your position in the absence of public opinion polls and public voting.”"

The sale represents a dramatic turn for the homes themselves, which were originally supposed to be quickly sold to single families, but will now be permanently rented out by Pretium Partners, a New York-based investment firm run by former Goldman Sachs partner Donald Mullen. The homes Pretium purchased are reportedly scattered across 20 U.S. markets, according to the Wall Street Journal.

“Pretium has long been committed to providing quality housing options for residents,” a spokesperson for Pretium told Motherboard. “At a time when move-in-ready homes are in short supply, we continue to invest in communities and improve access to housing throughout the U.S.”

Pretium, which now owns roughly 70,000 single-family homes, has become a force in the rental market, offering leases to families who themselves have been priced out of the home-buying market but want access to the suburban lifestyle. According to the company’s own website, Pretium’s residential portfolio has surged in recent years, more than doubling between June 2019 and June 2021.

That growth has come with allegations of callousness and worse. Earlier this year, a nonprofit tracking evictions by corporate landlords listed Pretium as “by far the most frequent filer of evictions” after the CDC’s 2020 eviction moratorium took effect. The nonprofit claimed that Pretium evicted residents in majority-Black Georgia counties at seven times the rate it did in majority-white Florida counties, filing to evict tenants from nearly a quarter of the homes it owned in majority-Black DeKalb County, Georgia in the first six months of 2021. It also said that “predominantly Black residents in Minneapolis” said Pretium is failing to adequately maintain their rental homes. Pretium’s Progress Residential also described the moratorium as an “unconstitutional overreach” in a court filing, according to the nonprofit.

Pretium pushed back aggressively against the claims when asked about them by Motherboard, saying that the nonprofit in question, the Private Equity Stakeholder Project, had “a decidedly biased agenda” and was pushing “half-truths, false claims and outright lies.” Pretium added that it had offered $60 million in assistance that included rent forgiveness and relocation assistance to residents during the COVID-19 pandemic and invests an average of $50,000 in homes over a five-year period.

“Pretium has acted in full compliance with CDC Moratorium and Fair Housing laws, and have never evicted a resident covered under a valid CDC declaration for non-payment of rent,” the company spokesperson told Motherboard. “We pride ourselves on our commitment to providing high-quality, affordable housing options, outstanding service and housing stability, particularly during times of crisis.”

More generally, eviction practices, which disproportionately harm members of marginalized communities, have caught the attention of the federal government this year. In March, the Federal Trade Commission and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau issued a joint statement about “reports that major multistate landlords are forcing people out of their homes,” and said that both agencies would be investigating. In May, they sent letters to major landlords reminding them of their obligations under the law.

Zillow ended the most recent quarter with a little under 18,000 homes that it either owned or was in the process of purchasing, according to the company—all of which it plans to sell in the coming months. A Zillow spokesperson told Motherboard in a statement the company is hoping to offload the homes “as quickly as possible,” which means they are willing to sell to whoever is willing to buy them, including “individuals and families, institutional or individual investors, and nonprofits.”

Zillow had previously hoped to become a massive player in the burgeoning iBuyer industry, in which companies buy moderately priced homes in decent shape, then quickly fix them up and flip them, pocketing a convenience fee and, ideally, any appreciation. But the company struggled to accurately price homes and determined the potential reward was not worth the risk of figuring it out along the way as they spent millions on American homes. Ultimately, in early November, the company decided to kill the home-buying program, sell off the homes, and lay off 25 percent of its workforce.

Pretium paid market price for the homes as part of the deal with Zillow, although Zillow expects to lose money on the whole as it offloads its inventory."

Of the 62 bouts former world champion Manny Pacquiao won in his 26 years in boxing, his favorite was against Oscar de la Hoya, who was taller, heavier, and arguably the bigger star when they battled in 2008.

“It was amazing. I mean, nobody expected that I was going to win the fight,” Pacquiao said in a live interview with VICE World News on Nov. 8. “But, like I told [my team], in God all things are possible. As long as you believe and have faith, you can have it.”

For his many fans who watched him rise from hungry street kid to multi-millionaire boxing icon, 42-year-old Pacquiao has already achieved the impossible. Now that he’s officially retired from boxing, he hopes to accomplish yet another unlikely feat: to become president of the Philippines.

He insists on running for president in the upcoming May 2022 national elections because he believes he can make a difference.

“I’ve been helping people since 2002 until now, and there are so many people suffering and starving. And what I saw in the government is these politicians—most of them are corrupt. They’re stealing money from the government, stealing money from the people,” he said

He names corruption and poverty—the country’s perennial and intertwined problems—as the enemy. Recent Philippine history is replete with high-profile corruption scandals, and every politician who’s ever aspired to become president has promised to eliminate the issue.

Pacquiao spoke of the corruption he said he witnessed in the government earlier this year, as the election season drew near and it became apparent he wouldn’t receive the backing of President Rodrigo Duterte—whose mandatory single term is ending—despite them belonging to the same political party.

Now, he is making the same promise Duterte made when he campaigned in 2016: a ruthless purge of corrupt officials. What makes this pledge different coming from Pacquiao?

“I think the difference is my sincerity—my love for the Filipino people, my love for my country,” he said.



No presidential aspirant can claim to know the troubles of ordinary Filipinos like Pacquiao, who used to wait at stores for leftovers to feed his family. But how far will this sincerity go if he wins the presidency, and those corrupt officials turn out to be friends and allies who supported him in his fights?



When he announced his retirement from boxing in September, he thanked some four dozen people and families who had helped him along the way, many of them politicians. Would he have the courage to put friends in jail?

“I’m serving the people, not my friends. So if you have an issue of corruption, then [there is] no compromising,” he replied. “I will send you to jail.”

The Duterte administration is currently embroiled in a corruption scandal regarding millions of dollars’ worth of seemingly irregular purchases of medical supplies during the pandemic. Duterte has repeatedly lashed out at senators conducting the investigation, and defended his allies allegedly involved in the scam.

As a senator himself, Pacquiao is part of the panel running the probe.

“I criticize the president because I’m against corruption. Corruption is the cancer of this country,” he said, stopping short of saying Duterte himself is corrupt.

“I mean the people around him. The people around him—there’s a lot of issues. That’s why we are trying to investigate all those issues of corruption.”

But Pacquiao’s opponents for the presidency are formidable and experienced politicians—they include a dictator’s son, a movie star who’s now mayor of Manila, a police general who’s now a senator, and the incumbent vice president.

He lags behind most or all of them in different public preference surveys for presidential candidates. But armed with his faith and sure of his intentions, Pacquiao says he is unfazed.

“Even me, I’m asking myself why I’m in politics, why I’m here,” said Pacquiao, who became a congressman in 2010 and is currently a senator. “I understand that God put me here for a purpose—I’m here to discipline and clean this country from corrupt practices of politicians.”

Until recently, Pacquiao had not been vocal about the country’s problems. Critics have panned his lackluster performance as a lawmaker, and he’s often ranked the top absentee at congressional sessions owing to his boxing matches and training.

Pacquiao used to be a staunch defender of Duterte’s most controversial policies: namely the war on drugs, that has killed at least 6,000 people according to official data, and his push to reinstate the death penalty. No longer a Duterte ally, he now has a nuanced approach to these issues.

“I will continue the drug war, but in the right way,” he said. “You don’t need to kill them in the streets without due process to defend themselves in court.”

Pacquiao said he is putting a death penalty bill he filed on hold, acknowledging problems in the judicial system. “I don’t want innocent people to be punished by death.”

But this compassionate stance ends where his evangelical faith draws the line.

“I’m against same-sex marriage. Being a Christian, I am against that. In terms of belief, I am against that,” he said. “But it doesn’t mean that I condemn them.”

There are many members of the LGBTQ+ community among his staff and in his family, he added. “I’m not condemning them. I love them.”



But for Pacquiao, the tenets of religion supersede any other law or principle.

“Everybody should be bound by the authority, the law, the government. Because the authority is established by God and instituted by God,” he said. “Even the president is bound by the authority.”

Besides moving to jail corrupt politicians, if he does become president, Pacquiao says the first thing he will do is “plan how we can give jobs to people, how to make the economy normal.” He was unable to give firmer details, however, as to how he plans to improve livelihoods and spur economic growth.

He had ready answers to questions about every major issue confronting the Philippines: The COVID-19 pandemic? Mass vaccination. The South China Sea territorial dispute? Talk it over with China. Poverty? Create more jobs by helping out small businesses.

But he is also acutely aware that he still has a lot to prove to win the country’s top post, a challenge he said he is familiar with having been the perennial underdog, even in boxing.

“My dream is to be a champion in different weight divisions in public service,” Pacquiao said, alluding to his status as the only boxer in history to win 12 titles in eight weight divisions.

Boxing taught him “determination, action, focus and sincerity,” lessons that he says can make a good president.

To the critics who doubt his capabilities—just watch, he tells them.

“Although they belittle me, I will do everything to amaze them, just as I had done in boxing.”"

Jacob Chansley, known as the QAnon Shaman, is facing over four years in jail for his role in the Capitol riot, the stiffest penalty prosecutors have yet to recommend for any insurrectionist.

In a late-night court filing on Tuesday, federal prosecutors said in a memo that they were recommending a sentence of 51 months for Chansley, who became the face of the January 6 riots as a result of his striking appearance.

Shirtless, with his face and torso covered in red, white, and blue paint, and wearing a Viking hat adorned with fur and horns, Chansley was among the first to breach the Capitol. He was also carrying a bullhorn and a spear-tipped pole with an American flag tied to it.

“The government cannot overstate the seriousness of the defendant’s conduct as one of the most prominent figures of the historic riot on the Capitol on January 6, 2021. Armed with a six-foot-long spear, the defendant brazenly marched past dozens of law enforcement officers, with rioters throwing debris of all kind at those who opposed them, past broken windows and through doors ringing with alarm bells,” prosecutors wrote in their memo.

To date, only one other Capitol rioter has been sentenced on felony charges. Paul Hodgkins, who also breached the Senate chamber, was sentenced to eight months in prison after prosecutors sought an 18-month term.

Another Capitol rioter, former MMA fighter Scott Fairlamb, who has pleaded guilty to assaulting a police officer during the attack, is due to be sentenced Wednesday. The government is seeking a 44-month sentence.

Prosecutors argue that Chansley, who will be sentenced on November 17, deserves a longer sentence than both Hodgkins and Fairlamb, because of his social media posts urging followers to “stop the steal”, the fact he was brandishing a six-foot spear, and because he was among the first 30 people to breach the Capitol.

Prosecutors also mention the speech Chansley gave from the dais in the Senate chamber once inside.

“Thank you, Heavenly Father, for gracing us with this opportunity...to allow us to send a message to all the tyrants, the communists, and the globalists, that this is our nation, not theirs,” Chansley said, according to a quote that opens the prosecution’s sentencing memo.

In contrast, the sentencing memo filed on behalf of Chansley by his lawyer Al Watkins opens with a quote from the movie Forrest Gump (which Watkins misspells in his filing):

“My momma always said, you’ve got to put the past behind you before you can move on.”

Watkins continues to highlight similarities between his client and the character portrayed by Tom Hanks in the film, saying Chansley, too, was bullied and ostracized as a child for being an “oddball.”

Watkins, who is seeking a sentence of time-served, claims Chansley suffers from undiagnosed mental health issues, which is one of the reasons for his “apparent Forest Gump-like obliviousness to much of the activity and many of the actions of those surrounding him as he approached, entered, and traversed the Capitol.

Watkins portrays his client as an unwitting player in the Capitol riots, but the prosecution’s memo highlights how Chansley used social media platforms like Facebook, Rumble, Parler, and YouTube to foment anger by spreading lies about the 2020 presidential election result.

“We shall have no real hope to survive the enemies arrayed against us until we hang the traitors lurking among us,” Chansley wrote in a Facebook post on November 19, 2020.

Watkins also outlined how Chansley complied with law enforcement in the days and weeks after the riot and showed remorse. But prosecutors highlighted an interview Chansley gave to NBC on January 7 in which he said: “The fact that we had a bunch of our traitors in office hunker down, put on their gas masks and retreat into their underground bunker, I consider that a win.”

He also called the FBI to admit he was the man seen wearing the Viking hat, adding that he was glad he sat in the Vice President’s chair because Mike Pence was a “child trafficking traitor”—a common QAnon trope.

Chansley has subsequently attempted to downplay his role in the attack, claiming in a 60 Minutes interview that law enforcement agents let him into the building.

Watkins also confirmed that just over a week after the insurrection Chansley “reached out to then-White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows to confirm a request for a Presidential Pardon of the Defendant and other peaceful individuals who had accepted the president’s invitation to go to the Capitol.”

The pardon never came, and Chansley subsequently labeled Trump “not honorable” for letting “a lot of peaceful people down.”

Chansley has already been in prison for over 300 days and has spent the vast majority of that time in solitary confinement as a result of COVID-19 protocols, spending over 22 hours a day in his cell. His family, based in Arizona, is unable to travel to Virginia, where Chansley is incarcerated, to take advantage of the two 30-minute slots available for visitors each week.

“​​He suffers from severe anxiety, panic attacks, and a constant feeling of claustrophobia while he is locked alone in his cell each day,” Watkins wrote.

Watkins claims that Chansley’s very appearance during the insurrection should be evidence enough of a troubled mental state.

“Chansley was half nude for the entire morning and early afternoon of a wintery January 6, when the temperature was in the 30s and low 40s in Washington, D.C. His tattoo-inked torso was on full display, his face carefully painted in the colors of the nation’s red, white and blue, his crown adorned by horns and his ‘costume’ accessorized by a fur pelt. His Shamanic chants were further indicia of mental health vulnerabilities,” Watkins wrote.

In the wake of the Capitol attack, many with the GOP and at right-wing media outlets have attempted to portray the incarcerated rioters as “political prisoners,” but Watkins says Chansley is not seeking such a designation.

“Chansley is not a political prisoner. He does not seek to be labeled such.”"

On Tuesday morning, hundreds of QAnon followers gathered on the grassy knoll in Dealey Plaza in downtown Dallas, believing they were about to see John F. Kennedy reappear.

These people had traveled from all over the U.S.—California, Florida, New York, Montana, and at least a dozen other states. On Monday night there was an almost carnival-like atmosphere in downtown Dallas, as they gathered in anticipation of the predicted return of the assassinated president, something they believed would also somehow trigger the return of former president Donald Trump to the White House and his announcement as “king of kings.”

But by early Tuesday afternoon, that sense of anticipation was fast disappearing, and as heavy rains started to fall, the people who had spent a lot of time and money traveling to Dallas to see JFK gave up and trudged back to their hotels.

But for many, the cost and effort it took to get to Dallas were not wasted, because even though they didn’t see JFK, many of them did get to meet the man they view as the manifestation of God on earth.

Michael Brian Protzman, 58, known to his tens of thousands of loyal and obsessive followers as Negative48, showed up in Dallas to see the prediction he’d made come true.

Protzman, born in the same year Kennedy was shot, has run his own demolition firm, called Eclipse Demolition, for the last 14 years from his hometown of Federal Way, Washington. Records show that the company went into administration last year, around the same time that Protzman was beginning a new career as a QAnon influencer.

But unlike most influencers, Protzman has effectively built a cult within the QAnon movement, where his followers refer to him as a godlike figure, are willing to travel across the country to see JFK resurrected, and most of all, continue to praise Protzman even when the miracle fails to materialize.

His rise within the QAnon world has been rapid. Back in March, his Negative48 Telegram channel had around 1,700 members; today, it has over 105,000 members. But aside from the number of followers Protzman has, what makes him stand out from other QAnon influencers is the loyalty and worship he has engendered in those people.

Protzman has used his newfound fame to spread deeply antisemitic content while pushing highly suspect financial investments to his followers, many of whom confessed within the channel that they are in vulnerable situations personally and are in need of help.

As well as denying the Holocaust, Protzman’s channel has boosted the deeply antisemitic film Europa – the Last Battle, a 10-part film that claims Jews created Communism and deliberately started both world wars as part of a plot to found Israel by provoking the innocent Nazis, who were only defending themselves.

“If you haven’t watched the documentary Europa: The Last Battle 2017, here’s the link,” said the post, sent on Oct. 2. It has been viewed over 38,000 times.

He has also promoted the film Adolf Hitler: The Greatest Story Never Told and said that if Trump had done what was needed, he would have been compared to the Nazi leader.

Protzman attempts to hide his hatred of Jews by discussing conspiracies related to the Khazars, an antisemitic dog whistle that’s been used by conspiracy theorists for centuries.

But in an audio chat in May, Protzman declared to his followers that “there are no Jews. Period. Anywhere. Period. There is no Jewish race. And the Jewish leadership are basically the British empire, the Roman empire, it’s just the criminals.”

Like many grifters, Protzman is pushing questionable financial advice to his followers. In this case it involves investing in foreign currencies like the Iraqi dinar or the Vietnamese dong, under the pretense that a “great financial reset” is coming and will revalue those currencies on a 1-to-1 basis with the dollar, instantly creating millions of dollars in wealth for those who have invested.

While Protzman tells followers they can buy the currency anywhere, he says that the best way to do it is by signing up on a website he promotes where users have to sign a non-disclosure agreement before making their purchase, an agreement which he said on an audio chat in May that forbids them from discussing the details of the transaction.

“The stuff that I have seen has shaken me to my core,” one researcher who has been tracking Protzman’s activity for months told VICE News. The researcher, who tweets at the Exposing Extremism account, was granted anonymity to protect himself from attacks by Protzman or his acolytes. ”They are brainwashing people with English gematria.”

Protzman’s popularity is built on a bastardized version of numerology known as gematria, a Jewish system of assigning a numerical value to a name, word, or phrase based on the letters used and inferring some sort of spiritual or mystical meaning behind the phrase.

Protzman’s fake gematria is based on English (A=1 to Z=26) rather than Hebrew (Aleph=1 Taf=400)—a system Protzman appears to have co-opted from a similar method developed by English occultist Aleister Crowley.

Protzman applies this fake version of gematria to passages of the Bible as well as QAnon phrases, freely mixing the two worlds to create a link between Christianity, QAnon, and the Kennedys.

Protzman uses this system as “proof” to support the complex and fantastical lies he has told his followers.

In Protzman’s telling, Jesus Christ married Mary Magdalene and had four children with her. This gave rise to a bloodline that went on to create many famous people today, notably the Kennedys.

He also claims that blood-type O is a marker for the Christ bloodline and that the “New World Order” is trying to hunt down that bloodline by DNA testing COVID-19 PCR swabs.

In Protzman’s fantasy world, John F. Kennedy and Jackie Kennedy are the physical second incarnation of Jesus and Mary Magdalene, while JFK Jr. is the Archangel Michael, and Donald Trump is the Holy Spirit.

In videos captured of Protzman in Dallas this week, he is seen speaking as if in a trance channeling some higher source and taking words or phrases, assigning them numeric values, and then linking those phrases to other words and phrases with identical values—implying some sort of meaning in those connections.

When JFK failed to materialize in Dealey Plaza on Tuesday, Protzman and many of his followers went to a Rolling Stones concert, where many claimed they met Michael Jackson in disguise.

Protzman did not respond to multiple calls from VICE News to his cell phone, or to text messages, WhatsApp messages, or emails. Calls to a number listed for Protzman’s business went unanswered, while calls to a number listed for his residence was answered by someone who said “no one of [Protzman’s] name lives here.”

As outrageous and unhinged as Protzman’s claims may sound, he has clearly tapped into a demand for these messages.

While other similar groups on Telegram also pushed followers to travel to Dallas, their basis for doing so was Protzman’s predictions. And unlike other online conspiracy influencers, Protzman has so much sway over his followers that he was able to get them to travel from all corners of the country and show up in Dallas based solely on his word that a miracle was going to take place.

While many within the broader QAnon community blasted Protzman and his followers for making a mockery of the movement by staging such a stunt—no, really—and despite the fact the Kennedys didn’t appear at Dealey Plaza, Protzman’s followers remain loyal.

In one group chat on a Telegram channel filled with followers of Protzman on Wednesday evening, one follower said: “I am so energized and feel amazingly positive about all of this.”

Another said: “I think Dallas was a great success,” adding, “I'm so proud of Negative and the people that went there.”

During another live stream chat on Wednesday night, one woman claimed her menstrual cycle was altered as a result of the power of the spirit she encountered at the event.

After everyone finished praising the event, the participants turned to discuss a rumor that former President Donald Trump was going to suddenly reappear at the White House at 9 pm ET on Wednesday evening and address the nation. Trump did not speak from the White House on Wednesday evening.

In the early hours of Thursday morning, another chat was organized by Randell Moody who is known online as Pryme Minister. Moody was also in Dallas and at one point during the event, he passed out while Protzman was declaring himself to be John F. Kennedy and Jesus Christ.

During a live stream on YouTube in the early hours of Thursday morning, Moody claimed he had met Michael Jackson at the Dallas event; he also claimed he had met around 5,000 people there, even though videos from the event show several hundred attendees at most.

In an audio chat on his Telegram channel, Moody’s outrageous claims continued. He claims that he experienced a conversation with the “Galactics” at the Rolling Stones gig, that “Q is God” and that “when I look at Michael Protzman I feel like I'm looking at God, it was quite powerful.”

Moody seeks to monetize his following by directing them to his website, which offers links to discounted “quantum health products” and CBD oils.

When VICE News spoke to Moody on Thursday he attempted to rehash much of the same conspiracy theories Prtozman has laid out in recent months, but when challenged about providing evidence of these claims, he ended the call.

This week’s event in Dallas was roundly mocked in the media and even among some other factions within QAnon, but for Protzman and his followers, the event was a huge success, proving that no matter how outrageous the claims you make are, you will still find people to follow you.

And given Protzman’s obvious antisemitic views, what comes next could be even more troubling.

“I really think this was a test run because they're taking some of the most extreme ideas and trying to test that out on people,” the Exposing Extremism researcher said. “And potentially they could try this with something much more reasonable but still disconnected from reality and do it as a way of basically creating a new Nazi Party.”"

While Rodgers said at an August press conference that he’d been “immunized,” it turns out—according, at least, to a vaguely-sourced NFL.com report—that he meant that he’d received an alternative homeopathic treatment meant to “raise his antibody levels.”

Advertisement

This is not how antibody levels work, homeopathic “vaccines” are not real vaccines, and, yet again, an athlete’s bizarre and wrongheaded stance on vaccination is revealing a powerful undercurrent of dangerous pseudo-medical bullshit that is pervasive even among America’s wealthiest and most powerful.

According to the strenuously neutral piece of reporting on NFL.com, Rodgers, who tested positive for COVID this week, “previously had sought and was denied an exemption from the NFL-NFL Players Association COVID-19 protocols based on his antibody levels this summer.” The site reported that Rodgers had “received homeopathic treatment from his personal doctor to raise his antibody levels.”

Athletes First, a talent agency and PR shop for NFL players, has not responded to questions from Motherboard about what, precisely, Rodgers was taking, and likely never will. But the description of a homeopathic treatment meant to raise his antibody levels sounds awfully like homeopathic “vaccines,” which are a recognized piece of pseudo-scientific bunk that have been promoted to vaccine-hesitant parents for years as a purportedly safe “alternative” to vaccines.

Also known by the name “nosodes,” these faux-vaccines are, like all homeopathic medicines, supposedly made from a biological substance that has been heavily diluted. In the case of nosodes, this is often diseased tissue or an infectious agent; homeopathy relies on the principle of “like cures like,” the idea being that something which can sicken a person in a large amount would activate their immune response when taken in a diluted form. But that dilution, of course, means that people taking homeopathic medicines are in essence just taking meaningless, completely inert tinctures or sugar pills. This is in no way similar to receiving a vaccination. During COVID (and long before, in some circles), homeopathic remedies have also been promoted as a way to counter vaccine “side effects,” which is also unreserved bullshit and functions solely as a way for natural health practitioners to sell products that don’t work.

It’s worth noting, finally, that much of the online discussion around Rodgers’ bad medical choices has also centered around his fiancee, actor and well-known woo enthusiast Shailene Woodley. She’s issued a variety of wacky, do-not-try-this-at-home wellness pronouncements over the years, including professing a love for homeopathy and making her own medicines. A homeopathic medicines company quoted her in 2012 as saying that their products are “the only medicine I use.” In an interview with beauty site Into the Gloss, she also enthused about eating clay, telling the site, “I first heard about the benefits of eating clay from a taxi driver. He was African and was saying that, where he’s from, the women eat clay when they’re pregnant. Seriously—ask your taxi drivers where they are from and about their customs. You will learn a lot.” What Woodley described sounds a lot like pica, a medical condition in which children and, occasionally, pregnant people compulsively eat non-food substances. (Pica is often seen in people suffering from anemia or malnutrition.)

A PR representative for Woodley did not immediately respond to a question about whether she, too, is taking homeopathic “remedies” for COVID prevention. A Woodley fan Twitter account pointed out that the show she’s currently working on does have a mandatory vaccination policy. Regardless, of course, Rodgers’ medical choices are his own, and his diagnosis this week should provide some powerful evidence about just how well they’re working out."

For a while now, Chinese social media users have been posting shots from the same sprawling parking lot. Behind them are blue skies and an industrial building with bright red and blue font that reads: “Costco Wholesale.”

Besides Prada’s recent wet market takeover, another unlikely influencer hotspot found in Shanghai is Costco, the American store chain known for its boxy warehouse, wide variety of products, and competitive prices.

On RED, China’s Instagram-like social media platform, people share influencer-esque shots of themselves in front of the big-box store’s branch in Shanghai. Opened in 2019, it’s the first Costco store to operate in mainland China.

These Costco photoshoots on Chinese social media often share the same theme—references to Los Angeles and users “pretending to be in L.A.” are commonly found in the title of such posts.

The trend appears to have been going around for at least a year, with one post dated October 2020 sharing tips on how to take photos at Shanghai’s Costco so that it looked like Los Angeles.

However, after international reports of Chinese social media users supposedly “pretending they're in L.A.,” these old posts are now flooded with a fresh wave of critical comments by other Chinese netizens. Many accused these Costco photo takers of idolizing Western culture, a subject that’s especially touchy in China.

“This is just a regular supermarket for Americans, but surprisingly there are people taking selfies at the entrance. You’re really embarrassing yourself in front of foreigners,” reads one such comment posted in late October. In the post, a woman poses in a shopping cart, the iconic Costco sign clearly visible behind her.

A social media user who goes by Darcy on RED told VICE that likening Costco and its surroundings to a foreign city is simply an “objective description.”

“Costco originated in North America, and when it came to Shanghai, it retained its distinctive container-style design,” she said. “There’s no need for everyone to overanalyze the choice of words in the title.”

In August, Darcy posted photos of herself casually sitting in a shopping cart outside Costco, and showing off a large pizza—both popular photo concepts widely shared on Chinese social media.

“You’re being mocked abroad, the place that you aspire to be,” reads a comment on Darcy’s post.

It’s unclear if the influencers were really trying to fool their followers into thinking that they’re in L.A., but considering the numerous titles and captions that openly acknowledge the attempt to give off L.A. vibes, many of these Costco photos appear to be more tongue-in-cheek—a creative effort to recreate foreign sceneries during a time when international travel remains restricted.

“‘Pretending to be in L.A.’ has quickly become a way for influencers to earn clout… and leaving the country has become a challenge due to the COVID-19,” said Fiona Zhang, a social media user who has also hopped onto the Costco trend.

“Taking good looking photos while shopping is also one of the consumption ways of young people today,” said Zhang, adding that she thinks Costco has gone viral because it has an aesthetic that is currently rare in China.

For Zhang, Darcy, and others who vibe with parking lot photoshoots, the Costco issue is just a storm in a wholesale teacup.

“Influencers who share these photos online also hope that they can share their photo-taking experiences with viewers, and provide inspiration for lifestyle photoshoots,” Darcy said.

“Whether those who see our photos like our choice of scenery, depends on the individual. We can’t not share our photos just because some people don’t like them.”

A second Costco store in Suzhou is now preparing to open its doors to shoppers. With any luck, Chinese netizens may see a lot more Costco-core shots on their social media feeds."

One Virginia man supplied the internet evidence that old-fashioned racist dog-whistling about “critical race theory” delivered the election to Youngkin. Some ventured that Youngkin won by disavowing Donald Trump (this didn’t happen). Or maybe he won by farming out the Trumpism to Steve Bannon and a menagerie of pro-insurrectionists, who pumped it through their siloed media channels (this definitely did happen). If you feel like giving McAuliffe a break, President Joe Biden’s approval numbers are awful, and that’s all you need to know.

But here's what I think is most important for us here at Breaking the Vote:

Whatever their other concerns, a majority of voters in Virginia don’t think an attempted coup by the current leader of the GOP, nor the party’s ongoing efforts to rewrite and cover up that coup attempt, disqualify the GOP from holding power less than a year later.

Most voters don’t read newsletters. They have jobs and kids and everyday worries outside politics. They might be sick of COVID restrictions and rising prices and feel like punishing the party in power. So they might not be thinking about looming authoritarianism and insurrections. Many in the base that surged for Youngkin are among the 60 percent of Republicans who’ve succumbed to Trumpists’ relentless lying about 2020 and believe Joe Biden stole the election.

Biden beat Trump in Virginia by 10 points just a year ago. But in the end, a state full of Biden supporters didn’t think the party whose leader tried to steal the last election and is enlisting that party to build the apparatus to steal 2024, is unfit to govern.

Youngkin started his race by getting close to Trump and getting his endorsement, then acted more distant as the race progressed. That’s pretty standard stuff, but Youngkin’s version included refusing to acknowledge Biden’s win for as long as possible, and harping on “election integrity” before leaving the Trumpist talk behind to be handled by others.

It matters because governors play a vital role in running fair elections. Youngkin's pro-insurrection supporters on the right stumped for him because they expect him to use his power to launch Cyber Ninja–style audits, appoint partisans to the State Board of Elections, and ensure that any future win by a Democrat in Virginia is automatically suspect.

I have no idea if it’s realistic to expect authoritarianism and memories of the Jan. 6 riot to motivate voters in a state election while gas prices are at a seven-year high and crime is on the rise.

But Trump, who of course is trying to take credit for Youngkin’s win, is telegraphing his plans to ensure victory in 2024 regardless of the vote count. He’s recruiting candidates who are on board to help (more on that below). This week in Virginia, support from rural conservatives swelled to give Glenn Youngkin a victory, and the Trumpist surrogates who made it happen expect to be repaid.

QAnon’s Unholy Alliance

Don’t miss VICE NEWS Tonight’s look at QAnon conspiracies coursing through American evangelical churches. Correspondent Vegas Tenold spent time with Pastor Greg Locke of the Global Vision Bible Church in Tennessee, whose familiar charismatic, tent-revival style of preaching is shot through with apocalyptic warnings about pedophile Democrats, demon-possessed elected officials, and Trump-promotion. Locke denies any connection to Q-thought, but as you can see, the labels hardly matter.

Locke says Joe Biden’s pedophilia, Kamala Harris’ demonic possession, and Democrats’ satanic evil are “fundamental staples” that he’s certain of, all while radicalizing his rapidly growing congregation against Trump’s political opponents. As many as a quarter of white evangelicals believe in “core tenets” of Q. And since the belief system has morphed from its antisemitic roots of infant blood–devouring puppet masters into a full-blown Trump radicalization cult, the political implications are profound.

Jan. 6: A Springboard to Office

When you’re done wondering if Virginia voters care about insurrection-supporting surrogates investing in their governor elections, take some time for Virginia’s new actual insurrection-attending government officials. Three candidates who attended the Jan. 6 demonstration at the U.S. Capitol won election to the state’s House of Delegates this week, according to this HuffPost report from Christopher Mathias. They include newly-elected restaurant owner Marie March, who bragged online about attending the “Stop the Steal” rally on Jan. 6 and also posted about a “coming Civil War” in which she was ready to die. Five other candidates known to have attended the Capitol riot but claimed to have not participated, won races for local offices in places like Idaho, New Jersey, and Connecticut.

By the way, that’s just the running tally of Jan. 6 rally attendees who won this week. HuffPost identified a total of 57 state and local officials who attended the rally, and a lot of them will be up for reelection next year.

Red Flags

If you looked around the crowd of current and future GOP elected officials and others on Jan. 6 and thought it was a protest of angry Trump supporters that spontaneously spun out of control, it’s time to put that idea to rest. Spend a while with the Washington Post’s “Red Flags,” an exhaustively-reported timeline of the months leading up to Jan. 6, the terrifying and lethal 187 minutes of the riot, and the long aftermath, where the FBI tracked and arrested rioters, congressional Republicans moved to block bipartisan investigations and accountability, and Trump and his supporters set about building a Republican Party for 2022 and 2024 based on advancing the lie that started it all.

One major takeaway from the new reporting: There were TONS of warnings that Trump’s drumbeat of election lies, his demands for action and his promotion of that morning’s “Stop the Steal” rally were attracting supporters planning on violence. Congressional investigations post-Jan. 6 focused mostly on one bulletin sent to the Capitol Police the day before from the FBI’s Norfolk, Virginia, field office warning of violent threats. Turns out that warning was one of dozens that never reached Capitol Police or were never acted upon.

It Was a Threat

Some of those efforts to intimidate officials in states Biden won came from Trump himself. Georgia Secretary of State Ben Raffensperger has a new book out where he brands Trump’s now-famous call on Jan. 2 urging him to “find” enough votes to overturn the election “a threat.” “Others obviously thought so, too, because some of Trump’s more radical followers have responded as if it was their duty to carry out this threat,” Raffensperger told AP.

The district attorney in Fulton County, Georgia, is still investigating whether Trump or anyone else violated Georgia election laws by trying to interfere in vote counts and certification. Meanwhile, Raffensperger, who certified Biden’s 12,000-vote win in Georgia, is Trump target #1 for 2022. He’s running for reelection against GOP Rep. Jody Hice, Trump’s handpicked primary challenger who voted to overturn the election results and has said 700,000 people voted illegally in Georgia.

Voting Rights vs. the Filibuster

Senate Republicans this week made it four straight filibusters on bills protecting voting rights, as states under their party’s control wrap up a year of making it harder to vote. This time it was the John Lewis Voting Rights Act, an update of the existing Voting Rights Act (VRA) after the Supreme Court gutted its most crucial provisions in 2013 and then again this year (read this for a quick primer on Section 5 and Section 2 and how they function(ed).

The last time the VRA was reauthorized, in 2006, it passed the Senate 98-0. So you might predict smooth sailing in 2021. You’d be wrong! Instead, exactly one Republican, Sen. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, voted to advance it.

The obvious question now is, what’s next? Reform-reluctant Delaware Sen. Tom Carper is the latest Democrat to come out in favor of killing the filibuster for voting rights legislation only and breaking the GOP’s combination of state-level voter restrictions and federal-level blockade. “The filibuster must be confronted, it must be overcome,"" NAACP Legal Defense Fund president Sherrilyn Ifill told reporters Wednesday.

Joe Biden has also signaled his support for a voting rights carve-out, but he’s not the Joe that matters. Sen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia is the most visible of a small group of Dems opposed to altering the filibuster for any reason. Other Democrats hope the object lesson of a Republican blockade where there was once consensus will soften his view.

“Short of bloodshed, I don’t know of any way to fix what we currently have going on. I’d take part in it. I’d just need someone else to be the leader.” -Wade Damms, 47, of Snowflake, Arizona, in the Washington Post’s Red Flags interactive report.

Rick Barron Taps Out - The director of elections in Fulton County, Georgia, is calling it quits after a year of scrutiny, harassment, and threats stemming from the 2020 election. You might remember Rick Barron from this piece a couple weeks ago, where he helped kick VICE News’ Breaking the Vote coverage by describing the intimidation and harassment Trump’s followers heaped on him after Georgia went blue.

Barron says he’s leaving to pursue other work. His department is also facing scrutiny under Georgia Republicans new voting laws, which allow the Legislature to enforce partisan control over county election officials, and ultimately, remove them. Fulton County, also known as Atlanta, is a heavily Democratic enclave that’s been the focus of Trump’s false narratives about 2020.

Barron told VICE News Tonight’s Madeleine May that the review isn't the reason he’s leaving, he just wants to try something new. As for the many threats he and his family have faced, Barron said this: “I think we have a lot of elected officials who could have stopped this, if they had spoken out. A lot of elected officials are cowardly and being led by a small segment of their constituency. Rather than leading, they are following. I have lost a lot of respect for people who are in this. It is difficult to reconcile. “

Trumpism’s Anti-Democratic Think Tank - Last week we introduced you to John Eastman, the right-wing lawyer who huddled in a “command center” with Rudy Giuliani and other Trump lieutenants in the Willard Hotel in the days before Jan. 6, and who, more crucially, prepared, disavowed, then re-embraced a road map for Trump detailing how then-Veep Mike Pence could overturn the election results on that day.

VICE News’ Cam Joseph has this piece going deeper into the Claremont Institute, where Eastman is just one of many thought leaders who played a role in events before, during, and since Jan. 6 at Trump’s favorite think tank. The “after” in this case refers to providing the intellectual basis for an anti-democratic conservative populism to take power, by any means necessary. That apparently includes helping recruit candidates devoted to Trump’s election lies for positions of power… over elections. Worth your time.

Rage Against the Machine - VICE News’ David Gilbert has the story on how a “Q-pilled’ Republican election official in Michigan was stripped of her Election Day duties for refusing to allow software updates to voting machines under her supervision. Adams Township Clerk Stephanie Scott was removed, but then came the twist: a voting machine went missing. A police search ensued.

DeSantis’ Office of Election Crimes - Florida GOP Gov. Ron DeSantis wants a new round of voting restrictions, and something original: an “Office of Election Crimes and Security” special police force to go after alleged voting fraud. DeSantis is up for reelection in 2022 and is eager to face down primary challenges in the heavily Trumpist Florida GOP. He’s also eyeing angles into the presidential race in 2024, possibly as an alternative to Trump himself. DeSantis previously praised the efficiency of the 2020 election in his state and signed legislation creating ballot drop boxes, which he now opposes. To lend the proposal dignity, DeSantis rolled out the $6 million “election crimes” plan at an event that featured supporters chanting “Let’s go Brandon!”, in-group code for “Fuck Joe Biden.”

DOJ Messes with Texas - When legislators label a bill with the number 1, you know it’s their top priority. The Justice Department late Thursday sued Texas over Republicans’ SB1 voting restriction law, arguing it harms voters’ rights by cracking down on mail-in ballots, banning drive-thru voting, and making it harder to vote absentee. Texas Republicans passed SB1 after a standoff with Democrats over the summer, which saw Dems flee Austin and fly to Washington, DC to try and delay the legislation. GOP Gov. Greg Abbott is up for reelection in 2022 and pushed hard for the new restrictions. You can read the lawsuit here, if that’s your jam.

In a country where conversations about sex is sticky business, one gynecologist is promoting sexual health awareness by creating a different kind of condom—one that adheres to the skin and can be used on both penises and vaginas.

“Day in, day out, I am confronted with patients suffering from the side effects of contraceptive methods, or from not using a method, or a failed method, leading to unintended pregnancies,” John Tang Ing Ching, a consultant obstetrician-gynecologist in Sibu, Malaysia, told VICE.

“For instance, it was not uncommon for me to face a schoolgirl breaking down in tears in my clinic when I told her that she was in advanced pregnancy.”

Many of Tang’s patients also grapple with sexually transmitted infections, including genital warts, herpes, and HIV.

Concerned about the cases of unplanned pregnancies and STIs he has come across in his 25 years as a reproductive health clinician, Tang set out to create a condom that could prevent these in ways that current designs do not.

The problem with many condoms today, Tang said, is that they could slip off. Condoms usually only work on erect penises, while those made for vaginas—which work by anchoring a ring inside the vagina—may slip or get misdirected inside the body. Existing condom designs also don’t cover enough area to provide full protection, especially from STIs that spread through skin-to-skin contact like genital herpes and HPV infections, Tang said.

Tang recalled bouncing his idea for an adhesive condom off his peers at a medical conference in Sibu seven years ago, before embarking on what he named the Wondaleaf Project—a cheeky reference to the leaves covering the genitals in depictions of Adam and Eve.

The Wondaleaf Unisex Condom comes with adhesive portions made to keep it attached to users. It also covers a larger part of the body, including the vulva and the base of the penis.

Unlike most condoms, the adhesive condom designed by Tang and his team at medical supplies company Twin Catalyst can be worn even during foreplay, before the penis gets hard.

Despite being home to the world’s biggest producer of condoms, Malaysia, a Muslim-majority country, still considers contraception taboo. Among those adopting more conservative attitudes, condoms are seen as immoral due to their association with non-marital sex.

“Many people have the opinion that [the] condom is kinky and maybe even immoral, but for us gynecologists, it is deadly serious,” said Tang, who aims to remove the stigma around sexual health.

“Perhaps, by the universal empowerment and the comprehensive dual protections, Wondaleaf Unisex Condom can help broaden our conversation on this dilemma.”

Tang said that the idea for the Wondaleaf Unisex Condom was inspired by personal protection equipment (PPE). Effective in preventing many infections, PPE were already commonly worn among healthcare workers even before the COVID-19 pandemic.

“So surely there must be an equivalent of PPE for sexual encounters,” Tang said.

The Wondaleaf Unisex Condom is 30 micrometers thick and made of medical grade polyurethane, a material that is widely used in wound dressings, though Tang said that it’s less sticky and won’t hurt when peeled off. Lube can also be applied on the skin before use to further reduce the condom’s stickiness.

Tang said that the condom he created also addresses some “minor but important issues”: confusing condom sizes, protection from pre- and post-cum, and stealthing, or the act of removing a condom during sex without your sexual partner’s knowledge.

For years, Tang and his team worked to secure funding, create prototypes, and arrange for clinical trials on the unisex condom. Now available online, the Wondaleaf Unisex Condom will be made available in stores in Malaysia in December. The team is still working on releasing the product internationally.

Twin Catalyst also has other products, such as the Wondaleaf Adhesive Pouch Dressing, a wound dressing that can be used for a variety of purposes such as male urinary incontinence and umbilical stumps. There’s also Wondaleaf Cap, a condom that sticks to the shaft of the penis and can stay attached regardless of the degree of erection.

To encourage more people to use the Wondaleaf condoms, Tang and his team are also toying with new flavors, textures, and designs. But they aren’t always on the same page.

“I have thought of durian flavor, but my team strongly advised me against it,” Tang said."

Among the trove of wild roleplay and bizarre COVID porn, a bespectacled man clad in a thick gray hoodie is an unlikely hit on Pornhub. Scribbling mathematical equations on a chalkboard and explaining them in utmost seriousness, the unassuming tutor has carved a niche for himself in a corner of one of the world’s largest porn sites without being even remotely sexual.

This isn’t some next-level take on professor roleplay or the nerdy side of Rule 34. No, we’ve just stumbled upon a tutor’s extremely earnest attempt to teach math.

Shun-Wei Chang, 34, who also goes by the stage name Changhsu, is a Taiwanese math tutor who runs a Pornhub account with over 7,000 subscribers. His channel, fronted by a cheeky “Play Hard Study Hard!” slogan, contains hundreds of videos of him explaining calculus. His videos have racked up almost 2 million views in total, making him a successful fully-clothed content creator in a space dominated by nudity.

“Play Hard Study Hard!” reads the banner on Chang’s Pornhub channel. Photo: Screenshot from Chang’s Pornhub channel

The titles of his videos often carry porn-related keywords such as “naked,” “giant breasts,” “masturbation,” “threesome,” and “oral sex”—a calculated move to make sure his videos would appear in as many keyword searches as possible, Chang told VICE.

While he has been posting math tutorials on Pornhub for over a year, he went viral after catching the attention of Taiwanese news outlets in October. Since then, he has been interviewed by international publications and even appeared on a live stream event on Pornhub’s official Instagram account earlier this month.

""A lot of people only see my marketing strategy and think it's interesting,"" Chang said. But as it turns out, driving the absurd antics was sheer desperation, as Chang grappled with a personal crisis.

Tuition centers (also known as cram schools) are lucrative businesses in Asia, where cut-throat competition in education systems force students to seek additional academic help from after-school tutoring.

Before last year, Chang was running his own tutoring center in Hsinchu, a city in northern Taiwan, along with a few co-workers he had hired. But Chang was caught off-guard in February 2020, when one of his co-workers opened a new cram school right above his.

“They took all my students upstairs, so my cram school suddenly lost all its income and could no longer operate,” he said.

Chang was suddenly left with the messy remains of his defunct teaching space and over NT$1 million ($35,900) in debt, including money he had borrowed from the bank to set up his school.

“The problem got so serious that at one point, I contemplated suicide,” Chang said. “I was simply in too much debt, and I wasn't confident that I could repay it quickly.”

But ultimately, Chang decided to start a new business where he could put his skills as a tutor to good use. He pivoted to online teaching, setting up a website that offers educational resources for students.

Chang tried to get the teaching website off the ground with several gimmicks, such as live streaming himself solving 100 calculus problems in 10 hours, as well as visiting universities across Taiwan to help students prepare for their end-of-term final exams.

With his massive financial problem breathing down his neck, Chang was working on an endless grind. In March 2020, Chang started filming a ton of tutorial videos to share online. For months, he was making 30 to 40 videos a day, and had even started sleeping in his abandoned tuition center so he could resume filming once he woke up.

But instead of pitting his tutorials against the avalanche of teaching videos that were readily available online, Chang and his team decided then to give them a different kind of exposure—they uploaded the videos on Pornhub that May.

“We thought of putting our videos in the most jarring place,” he said of the decision to shoot his content off to a platform that’s most known for catering to sexual—rather than academic—frustrations.

In Chang’s attempt to reach college students who could use some mathematical help, Pornhub turned out to be the perfect place to meet his target audience where they’re at.

Over about a year, Chang saw unprecedented traffic to his teaching material as more students purchased the courses on his websites. He also succeeded in earning enough to pay off his debts.

Other Pornhub users who stumble upon his videos also don’t seem to mind that the only content he posts are mathematical equations.

“Nothing like a nice Delta-Epsilon Proof for my post-nut clarity,” a user wrote under Chang’s video, just one of many similar comments poking fun at his calculus prowess.

But despite now being known as that Pornhub tutor, Chang has been keeping his hands off the adult website—his most recent Pornhub video was posted nine months ago.

“The original intention behind putting my videos on Pornhub was to get everyone's attention,” he explained. And now that he has it, he’s moving on to new things, starting with a revamp of his teaching platform set for sometime in December.

Chang said that he’s planning an auction for his famed gray hoodie. The proceeds will go towards helping students in rural areas who have difficulty accessing his online material. He beamed with pride as he flexed his iconic dark gray jacket over a video call, fondly recounting war stories with the chalky companion that had stayed by him during his foray into the sexy world of online teaching.

Throughout the hundreds of videos that he filmed, the hoodie hasn’t been washed once. The choice of teaching gear was two-fold, Chang explained. Firstly, he wanted the chunky clothing to stand out against the lack of garments on the rest of Pornhub.

“On an adult website, everyone else is naked, but I'm all wrapped up in thick clothing. There’s a clash,"" he said.

The more pragmatic, and less sexy, reason is that he had to shoot so many videos in one go that he simply couldn’t be bothered to change.

After picking himself up from a life-changing setback, Chang has come out of the other end with an encouraging message for his viewers.

“If there’s anyone facing intense struggles right now, I hope that my story can give them some strength, so they can believe that if they persevere, one day, there will be hope,” he said.

His teaching videos can also be found on YouTube, where he also features a bunch of other tutors.

The next time you’re on Pornhub, think of Chang, and maybe consider getting another flaccid subject up—your math grades.

Lovecraft.

Combining queer poetry, one-act plays about young gay love, and progressive social commentary, Les mouches fantastiques quickly gained a cult following far beyond the city and even Canada—culminating in a back-and-forth literary journal spat with the noted horror writer (and racist), who decried the magazine’s promotion of an “ancient selfish hedonism.”

From the 1950s to the mid-70s, Druid Heights attracted a revolving cast of guests and short-term residents that included some of the biggest names in the American cultural avant-garde, from Beat Generation writers like Allen Ginsberg and Gary Snyder, to musicians like Dizzy Gillespie and Steve Miller, to prominent feminist reformers Catharine A. MacKinnon and Margo St. James. For 12 years, it would serve as a hangout spot, and eventually a base of operations, for the influential philosopher Alan Watts, who popularized the practice of Zen Buddhism and the study of Eastern philosophy in the West.

Before long, Gidlow made a permanent move to the Bay Area. But it wasn’t until her 50s that she felt she’d finally found a place to call home: In 1954, she established what she called the “unintentional community” of Druid Heights, a collection of idiosyncratic, eco-friendly buildings scattered across 6 acres in Marin County. It was there—holed up in a small cottage up a windy mountain road, living off pesticide-free crops from her garden—that she would complete work on nine more books and live out the rest of her days. One of them was Elsa, I Come with My Songs, regarded as the first autobiography by a lesbian in which the author did not use a pseudonym.

In 1920, Gidlow moved to New York City, bringing Les mouches to a close after a five-issue run. Three years later, while living in Manhattan, she published On a Grey Thread, making history once again as the author of what historians believe to be the first openly lesbian poetry book released in North America. By attaching her real name to the work, Gidlow risked the very real possibility of imprisonment on indecency charges—a common tactic the federal government used against other gay writers of the era. Somehow, she evaded repercussions.

In 1977, the National Park Service absorbed Druid Heights into the Muir Woods National Monument, an area of historic redwood trees it had folded into the recently created Golden Gate National Recreation Area (or GGNRA), a sprawling nature preserve on the outskirts of San Francisco that would become one of the most visited national parks in the U.S. After the government invoked eminent domain, only legal tenants were allowed to live there, ending its status as a revolving door for artists and thinkers.

At its height in the late 1960s, the community was home to around 34 people—and to one of the most fascinating chapters in American counterculture and LGBTQ history. Gidlow had plans to turn it into one of America’s first retreats for women artists. That is, until the federal government decided it wanted the land in 1972, setting off a chain of events that would not only threaten the community’s continued existence, but to erase it from collective memory.

In 2018, The Cultural Landscape Foundation, an historic preservation non-profit, included Druid Heights on its list of U.S. endangered places. Local Park Service representatives told VICE that only four to six full-time residents remain.

Today, what once resembled a bustling small village—replete with a dozen residences, a library, a community center, places of worship, and a water tank—has been reduced to only four habitable buildings. Many of the wildly imaginative structures that once dotted the land are now crumbling, damaged by decades’ worth of water, pests, insects, mold, and trespassers, as documented in 2016 NPS surveys. That same year, a visitor to the property observed that a tree had come close to destroying Gidlow’s house, although the structure remains mostly sound. Gidlow’s personal garden, which she tended long before the concept of “organic” food hit the mainstream, is overgrown with trees and shrubs.

Gidlow stayed at Druid Heights until her death, in 1986. A series of tenants rented out her portion of the property until 2005. Since then, her parcel has sat uninhabited. And though the Park Service has conducted some vegetation removal, rodent protection, and roof replacement on the site as a whole, the federal government has otherwise largely left its fate up to the elements.

“It's high time for the NPS to take responsibility for preserving this site of national significance for LGBTQ history, women's history, and bohemian and countercultural history,” LGBTQ historian Gerard Koskovich said. “The apparent federal obfuscation, foot-dragging and practice if not policy of demolition by neglect with regard to Druid Heights is a scandal.”

But preservationists and LGBTQ advocates who support the rehabilitation of Druid Heights say that the agency has done little to prevent the site from vanishing into oblivion. They get the sense that the NPS doesn’t even want people drawing attention to the place.

The site’s poor condition is representative of a larger trend in historic preservation. Because of centuries of general anti-gay sentiment and laws punishing queerness, little queer history has been preserved, and much of it has been erased—a fact the Park Service acknowledged in its 2014 LGBTQ Heritage initiative, which identified Druid Heights as a site of significance. “By recovering the voices that have been erased and marginalized, the NPS embarks on an important project to capture and celebrate our multi-vocal past,” the agency stated.

The government didn’t reveal that it had ambitions for the site until 2011, when park authorities announced it intended to preserve the district and get it listed on the National Register of Historic Places, an honorific that would attract media exposure, tourism, and potentially funding for its rehabilitation. Druid Heights has been eligible for the Register since 2018; if it gets listed, it will be the first federally designated LGBTQ historic district in the United States. But each passing day brings uncertainty about the site’s survival.

There’s no singular reason as to why the Park Service hasn’t done more to preserve Druid Heights. The property’s journey through the National Register eligibility process and federal review procedures has been a complicated and protracted affair, exacerbated by concerns over residents’ privacy and a lack of funding. Still, the property’s current dilapidated condition begs the question: Why is the federal government letting the closest thing America has to an LGBTQ historic district fall apart?

“For almost five years, excepting a couple casual encounters, I had not been in love nor made love,” Gidlow wrote in her autobiography. “With Isabel, I felt at once any relationship would not be casual.”

Eventually, Gidlow did choose to be constant to one mouth: that of Isabel Grenfell Quallo, a waitress who had charmed her way into the circles of actors and artists in New York. By then, Gidlow had been living in the Bay Area for nearly two decades, doing freelance writing and dipping into political work. Though they’d missed each other during a trip Gidlow took to the city in 1946, the two began exchanging letters on the insistence of a mutual friend. Eventually, Quallo crossed the country to visit Gidlow—and never left.

“You're jealous if I kiss this girl and that, You think I should be constant to one mouth? Little you know of my too quenchless drouth: My sister, I keep faith with love, not lovers.”

At the time, Gidlow was involved in a bit of a political revolution in her neighborhood of Fairfax, a small town north of San Francisco. Frustrated over a lack of road and street lamp improvements, she and her neighbors formed a taxpayers’ association. After running publicity for a successful campaign to boot several local elected officials out of office, Gidlow eventually joined the town planning commission. The ex-politicians accused Gidlow and her associates of being communists, and in 1947, California’s Un-American Activities Committee subpoenaed her to testify, citing her “radical” poetry as evidence. (Gidlow was more of a “philosophical anarchist.”) While the hearing ended up being a bust, the experience, along with the increasing urbanization of her neighborhood, motivated her to seek a more quiet life, away from prying eyes.

Despite its remoteness, the land, which eventually expanded to include another acre, was already partially developed. The previous owner had built five structures and lined the property with eucalyptus trees, then 50 feet tall, to help shield it from strong winds. By 1970, the number of buildings had tripled, thanks to the efforts of self-taught architect and jazz musician Roger Somers and his wife, Mary, who had originally shown Gidlow the property; woodworker Ed Stiles, who arrived with his wife in 1965; and other tenants.

In 1954, with the help of a loan collateralized by a friend—it was incredibly difficult for “single” women to get credit at the time—Gidlow purchased 5 acres of mountainous forest land in Mill Valley, Marin County, about 15 miles from San Francisco. She moved into the previous owner’s cottage with Quallo and dubbed the property “Druid Heights”: “Druid” was a reference to the ancient Celtic priests—“heights,'' to Emily Brontë’s Wuthering Heights.

“I knew here was the place to realize a dream that had been germinating for a long time, ever since a child sat beside a brook dreaming it.” —Elsa Gidlow

“Silently I absorbed the stillness, the sunny solitude, the scents from grasses and wildflowers and mingled eucalyptus and bay,” Gidlow wrote in her memoir. “I knew here was the place to realize a dream that had been germinating for a long time, ever since a child sat beside a brook dreaming it.”

By this time, Gidlow was living on her own again. After three years helping Gidlow and Somers tend the property, Quallo had returned to New York in 1957 to care for her daughters—leading the couple to split amicably, after ten years together. Still, Gidlow knew she’d found the sanctuary she’d been searching for.

As a horn player, Somers preferred a free-form style, breaking from the standard tempos and chord changes of cool jazz. He carried this aversion to conformity into his other interests. An avid craftsman, he designed the majority of the buildings at Druid Heights, with help from Stiles; many are made in a DIY style, combining far-flung architectural references with recycled building materials Somers salvaged himself.

Part of Gidlow’s dream, she later wrote in her autobiography, was “to give courage to others with urges to free themselves for deeper fulfillment than the ossified patterns of establishment culture permits.” The Bed, an experimental short film by queer poet, filmmaker, and regular visitor James Broughton, revealed Druid Heights to be the sort of place where people could freely channel these urges. Shot at the property during the infamous 1967 “Summer of Love,” it features multiple cameos from prominent Druid Heights figures, including a naked Somers playing the saxophone atop a metal headboard.

The Ranch House, which served as the community’s central hub, had an open floor plan inspired by Frank Lloyd Wright; its living room—known as the Shoji Room, or Zendo—took the form of a Japanese-style temple. There was a building wrapped around two oak trees, which grew through the walls and ceilings, and another, inspired by the shape of a large water tank, that was commissioned as a library for Alan Watts.

When he first started visiting the community, Watts frequented the Zendo inside the Wright-inspired house , later explaining that he admired the way Somers’ work eschewed the straight lines associated with modern Western architecture: “The world is a ball full of wiggles, and human beings must outgrow the idea of trying to straighten it out,” he proclaimed in his autobiography.

Gidlow had first crossed paths with Watts in San Francisco, where he taught philosophy at the Academy of Asian Studies. In 1962, after Gidlow had relocated to Marin County, they founded the Society for Comparative Philosophy, aimed at providing scholars, spiritual leaders, and other acolytes of Eastern philosophy with the means to conduct research, host lectures, and exchange ideas. While the organization was based out of a ferryboat in Sausalito at first, Watts would frequently make the trip up to Druid Heights to socialize with Gidlow and others. His 1962 book, The Joyous Cosmology, is dedicated to “the People of Druid Heights.” In 1971, he became a full-time resident.

Together, Gidlow, Somers, and Watts helped solidify Druid Heights' reputation as a safe haven for people rejected by mainstream American society. During a time of widespread segregation and racism across the U.S.—and when even other communes in California were predominantly white and heterosexual—Druid Heights openly welcomed people of all races. It counted Quallo, a Black woman, as one of its co-founders, and because of Somers' jazz connections, famous Black musicians like Dizzy Gillespie and Louis Armstrong would visit or perform there.

Wanting Druid Heights to be “a place for the growth of the spirit,” in addition to her cabbages and camellias, Gidlow often took in young women to mentor. One of her protégés was sex workers’ rights activist Margo St. James, who moved to Druid Heights in 1970. Gidlow’s mentorship inspired St. James to found Call Off Your Old Tired Ethics, or COYOTE, an early organization advocating for the decriminalization of sex work.

Once the circular redwood library was built in 1972, it became Watts’ official headquarters, and that of the Society for Comparative Philosophy. He wrote and held seminars there, as well as the occasional Japanese tea ceremony. Gidlow noted in her memoir that Watts’ voice “had a quality that captivated most listeners”—especially on acid trips, which had become a ritual of sorts at the community. People from around the world made the pilgrimage to Druid Heights to hear him speak.

Other well-known visitors include rock singer Neil Young, who commissioned Somers to remodel his tour bus in 1975, as well as comedian Lily Tomlin and singer Judy Collins. Feminist legal scholar and sexual harassment law pioneer Catharine A. MacKinnon resided there for a spell in the 80s. In short, Druid Heights was at the forefront of social change in American culture for at least three decades, bringing together some of the greatest minds of the 20th century and influencing the ideas they put out into the world. Then the federal government got involved.

By then, Gidlow had deeded her portion of the property to the Society for Comparative Philosophy. (She’d sold half of it to Somers in 1954, and later sold Stiles a portion of what remained in exchange for him building a house for her sister.) Given the group’s religious nature, Gidlow felt its property should be exempt from the government’s efforts. The government disagreed, and offered to pay the society $250,000 for the land—a figure Gidlow called “absurdly low.” She proceeded to launch a legal battle against the government. But facing the possibility of homelessness if she didn’t settle, she came to an agreement with the government in 1977.

In the late 1960s, real estate developers were eyeing large portions of unused military coastal lands in the Bay Area, while concerned citizens petitioned the government to save the natural spaces. At the same time, the uncertain future of Alcatraz Island, a decommissioned prison off the coast of San Francisco, became a subject of national attention after Indigenous activists occupied the abandoned facility for almost 19 months. Attempting to solve both issues at once, President Nixon signed an act establishing the Golden Gate National Recreation Area in 1972, creating a 34,000-acre region that linked existing parks together and immediately absorbed Alcatraz. Due to Druid Heights’ proximity to the Muir Woods National Monument, the federal government claimed eminent domain, meaning it took ownership of the land for public use, at a price they determined.

The government presented each of the three owners with the choice of a 25-year or life-long lease, to be deducted upfront from their individual payouts. Gidlow, almost 80 at this point, strategically chose the 25-year lease, hoping to maximize the Society for Comparative Philosophy’s time on the land; in exchange, they received just $82,000. Somers and Stiles, who were both much younger than Gidlow, each opted for the life lease.

That dream never materialized. Between her death and outstanding legal fees, the Society for Comparative Philosophy fell on hard times; the wild parties and spontaneous poetry readings had already stopped long before, and life at Druid Heights slowed down. Watts had died of heart failure in 1973, with some of his ashes buried next to the library that bears his name. Somers died in 2001, found in his hot tub. Stiles, who did not respond to multiple requests for comment, still lives there, maintaining his portion of the property. Gidlow’s side, and some structures on Somers' lot, are at risk of being lost forever.

When Gidlow died, she was buried in her beloved garden. In her autobiography, published a month before her death, she’d revealed the plan she ultimately had in store for Druid Heights. “My vision, my dream, has been taking shape for a long time,” she wrote. “It is of a place where compatible women might be brought together for shared activity on many levels. I have the space here for women artists who can develop a comradeship. I am calling it ‘The Druid Heights Artists’ Retreat.’”

“She said that it wasn’t news, and that I shouldn’t be writing a story about it,” Silverstein said. “She told me Margaret St. James never lived there. And I found many documents that contradicted that. ”

In January 2021, Nikki Silverstein, a reporter for the Pacific Sun, was sitting in her office when she received a strange phone call from an NPS ranger named Mia Monroe. Margo St. James, the pioneering sex workers rights advocate, had passed away a few days before, and Silverstein had messaged Monroe on Nextdoor to inquire about the status of Druid Heights, St. James’ former home. Silverstein had thought of it as a routine assignment. That's why she was shocked when the ranger called and told her to drop the story.

Though the state of California had formally deemed Druid Heights eligible for the National Register of Historic Places in 2018 , Silverstein found that the Park Service was effectively allowing the site to crumble. Under the park’s 2014 management plan, “National Register eligible and listed properties would be monitored on a regular basis to ensure their preservation.” But register inclusion doesn’t legally mandate preservation, and in the article Silverstein ended up publishing in the Pacific Sun, Monroe explained that “protecting the buildings may or may not happen”—even if Druid Heights eventually makes the list.

Monroe, who’s been a park ranger since 1978, later admitted to VICE in an email that she’d probably spoken “in haste”; mostly, she said, she’d been concerned that a story about Druid Heights would pose a safety risk, “encourag[ing] visits at a time when safety and privacy for residents was very risky due to COVID.” But her reply made Silverstein curious about the fate of the property.

A Marin County native born in 1959, Toivonen said that he’d heard stories about a famous philosopher and elderly poet who lived in the Muir Woods when he was growing up. “I never knew anything about any musicians going there, any rock stars, any unusual architecture—nothing like that,” Toivonen recalled. “It was really off the map.” He was researching Marin County history in 2016 when the name “Druid Heights” popped into his head.

This news devastated those passionate about preserving the space. One of them was Michael Toivonen, a retired woodworker and history buff based in Redwood Valley.

In an email to Toivonen, Monroe stressed the tricky balance between preservation efforts and respecting existing residents’ privacy, and claimed that “drawing further attention” to Druid Heights “makes it increasingly difficult for us to do our job.” “I think getting support and connections is helpful but not necessarily what's needed at this time but appreciate all the legwork you've done,” she wrote. (Monroe did not reply to a request for comment on the email.)

In 2017, Toivonen founded the group Save Druid Heights to preserve the once-thriving Bohemian community; its Facebook group has grown to over 1,400 members and counting, and it maintains the most extensive database on Druid Heights history to date. When he first informed Ranger Monroe about the group’s creation, though, Toivonen said he got the sense that the NPS didn’t want people publicizing the property.

Park Service documents from 2016, the same year as Toivonen’s initial visit, paint a grim picture of the property’s condition at the time. Trees had fallen on the Ranch House. The roof of the library, where Watts once delivered philosophical lectures, was leaking; the walls and ceiling had water damage, the carpeted floors were moldy, and there were signs of a rodent infestation. (For their part, NPS told VICE it “has conducted work at the site” over the years, including annual vegetation removal [and] building protection against rodents.”)

He contacted a high school classmate who lived near the area for directions and set off on a hike. To his disappointment, he discovered an array of dilapidated buildings, unlocked and overgrown with weeds. “I’m just amazed it's sitting here and being allowed to rot,” he said.

“How can you get the public [to] engage in an often rather wonky process of preserving a place if you don't really want the public to know much about it?” Toivonen said.

Toivonen also noted there are no placards or pamphlets in the park indicating that Druid Heights is a resource there, or even that it exists.

It’s common for the Park Service to delay repairs because of budgetary constraints; officials call this “deferred maintenance,” with the most recent data estimating an $11.9 billion national backlog. In order to decrease the backlog, NPS regularly proposes demolishing assets that have high repair costs and low relevance to the park’s mission. In other cases, where demolition seems less cost-effective, the agency has openly admitted to letting these low-priority assets sit idle and deteriorate.

“We have to prioritize among hundreds of historic structures, some which are used much more actively, for the funding we are allocated to best serve our agency's mandates and the millions of visitors we receive each year,” Julian Espinoza, a Public Affairs Specialist for the Golden Gate National Recreation Area, said in an email.

So why isn’t the Park Service taking action on Druid Heights? Officially, NPS says it’s due to lack of money, along with the fact that the historic property is managed as a private residential site and public access is not currently a park planning or funding priority.

By the time the 2014 management plan came out, Druid Heights had already undergone a lengthy review process known as Section 106, which requires federal agencies to actively identify and consult with key stakeholders , before reaching any final decision on actions that would affect a historic property.

When the plan finally came out in 2014, it presented a handful of different possibilities for how park staff might approach Druid Heights, regardless of Register eligibility. (Notably, the GGNRA management plan contains no mention of Gidlow, solely attributing Druid Heights' relevance to Watts.) One option called for demolishing virtually all of Druid Heights to prioritize natural resources; another, which the NPS indicated it preferred, called for the property’s preservation “to the extent practicable,” with limited public access. Although the agency settled on the latter option in January 2015, by all appearances it’s letting the site return to nature.

“We have to prioritize among hundreds of historic structures, some which are used much more actively, for the funding we are allocated to best serve our agency's mandates and the millions of visitors we receive each year.” —Julian Espinoza

Park documents obtained through a Freedom of Information Act request show that in 2010, the Service had initially determined that if Druid Heights failed to be eligible for inclusion on the National Register, it would be demolished. Although the Golden Gate National Recreation Area announced in 2011 that it intended to preserve Druid Heights and get it listed on the National Register, the agency indicated that the site’s fate would ultimately depend on its new management plan, a foundational document that dictates how staff should go about running the park for the next 20 years.

However, when coming to a decision on the future of Druid Heights, it is unclear whether the agency ever meaningfully consulted with organizations from the public, who could have fought for more preservation work.

In 2018, when Toivonen relayed his frustrations over the Park Service’s inaction toward Druid Heights to the GGNRA’s cultural resources director, the director suggested that key stakeholders in the project were all aligned with the Park Service’s approach and that Toivonen was alone in his dissatisfaction. “I know of no other Druid Heights stakeholders or residents that feel this way,” director Gordon White said in an email. “We have been in contact with all and have general agreement on our approach.” (White did not respond to multiple requests for comment).

Stakeholders can include state and tribal governments, members of the public, and historic preservation organizations with a “demonstrated interest in the project.” (For Druid Heights, stakeholders also include past and present residents, along with their descendants.) The process is meant to be “an important tool for citizens to lend their voice in protecting and maintaining historic properties in their communities,” a government advisory council notes on its website, adding that “agencies must give the public a chance to learn about the project and provide their views.”

Taken together, the agency’s lack of transparency with the public throughout the process and the property’s deteriorating state has led preservationists to believe the park’s “deferred maintenance” of Druid Heights amounts to “demolition by neglect,” as Koskovich put it: knowingly letting a historic site deteriorate, sometimes beyond the point of repair.

But six people associated with the Historical Society did not recall the Park Service ever involving the organization in planning efforts, including founding member and noted LGBTQ historian Gerard Koskovich. “It's clear the GLBT Historical Society should have been considered a major community stakeholder with regard to planning around Druid Heights,” Koskovich said. “And should now be given that status, if belatedly.” NPS told VICE in an email that staff spoke to individual members of the GLBTHS during their Register eligibility research, and that “all of the advocacy groups currently involved in the public media inquiries have received all of the information available and individual correspondence about any updates.”

There is one organization that seems like it would have been an obvious contender: the San Francisco-based GLBT Historical Society, an internationally-recognized leader in the LGBTQ public history field for more than three decades that has housed Gidlow’s personal archive since 1991.

But if money were the only issue, the NPS could recruit an outside group to put up the funds. The agency has put out proposal requests to rehabilitate the park’s historic military structures in the past, and its non-profit partner, the Golden Gate National Parks Conservancy, has a long track record of drawing attention and funneling funds to park areas in need. But the most it has done for Druid Heights to date is a series of invite-only walking tours, in 2011. (When VICE reached out, the Conservancy redirected questions to NPS, which declined to comment on this matter.)

There are clear financial reasons why the NPS might delay a determination on Druid Heights' future. The longer the agency ignores the place, the more likely it is that the structures will fall apart naturally, ultimately saving the agency preservation and demolition costs.

So what’s the hold-up? Toivonen said the agency may ultimately be deferring to the last remaining Druid Heights founder, Ed Stiles, who still lives among the buildings he helped construct. In a 2013 article about Druid Heights' future, Marin Magazine noted, without explanation, that he was “not particularly anxious that its story be told.” And when Toivonen first formed Save Druid Heights in 2017, he received an email from Stiles and his wife expressing that they wanted to see Druid Heights eventually “go back to nature.”

Whether the remaining residents have legal standing to dictate what happens on Gidlow’s side is unclear. They may also get a say on the fate of Gidlow’s lot as neighbors, since maintenance work would bring more people and noise to the area. Toivonen points out that the properties are spaced out, which could make it easier to avoid intrusion, though he firmly believes in respecting residents’ privacy and understands the concern.

Whatever the case may be, why exactly the Park Service is quietly allowing Gidlow’s lot to deteriorate, with no clear indication of when it will move ahead with repairs, remains a mystery, especially given that NPS has specifically pledged to preserve and share the stories of LGBTQ Americans.

“Studies show that when positive portrayal of populations (including LGBTQ, African Americans, Asian Americans, and Latinos) are excluded from popular narratives […], members of those groups suffer lower self-esteem,” NPS says on its website. “Seeing oneself as part of the story, as part of history, is important to feeling part of a society.”

Out of the thousands of historic sites the federal government owns, only a handful have been specifically recognized for their role in LGBTQ history. None of the federally owned historic sites have been officially designated as an LGBTQ historic district, and Druid Heights would be the first. While the privacy concerns add an extra layer of complexity, the Park Service’s inaction is ultimately contributing to the very same erasure the agency says it is committed to fighting.

“We are very sympathetic to the concerns of advocacy groups focused on this area, and disagree with their assertions about our lack of planning and management for the site,” a spokesperson for the GGNRA told VICE in an email. The spokesperson stressed that the Druid Heights historic area had “received significant attention” by park staff over the years, including checking in with residents on a monthly or weekly basis, conducting routine maintenance, and “planning as funding becomes available.”"

For many, it’s a celebratory day - one for placing bets, indulging in fashion, having a drink and rallying around the horses. For others, it highlights questions of animal cruelty and the ugly side of gambling, and dives into an archaic glorification of class and segregation. Increasingly, Australia’s younger population is deciding to ignore the event. The resounding question: What’s the point?

Media round-ups of drunken Australians attending the event is almost a tradition – in wheelie bins, passed out on the Flemington Racetrack steps, and pushing over police officers. The Cup has become an annual promise of clicks and eyeballs for the nation’s media. Even during a once-in-a-century pandemic, the 24-horse race was held and applauded – first without any crowd at all in 2020, and this year with an audience of 10,000.

Victoria, the state in which the race is held, celebrates an annual, state-wide public holiday in honour of the event. For locals, it represents a cultural phenomenon that, in recent years, has seen a shift of support in the public consciousness. In pre-COVID days, Melbourne race punters were generally turned away from the bars I worked in. They were either too drunk or didn’t mesh with the anti-race mentality that has begun to flourish in the city’s north.

After two years of on-and-off lockdowns - the longest cumulative lockdown in the world - mental health in Victoria has worsened, the economy has been thwarted, and the divide between rich and poor has grown. Add to that the growing pressure of anti-lockdown protests across Melbourne and the powder keg of simmering resentment Victorians were starting to feel for the rest of the nation. The state was at boiling point. By the time Australia’s most infamous horse race rolled around this year, the event had almost desperately been labeled “The Cup that starts a nation,” in an attempt to signal that things were going to be normal again.

Initially, when I was asked to go to the Melbourne Cup, I was nervous. Lockdowns are never good on feelings of social anxiety, and being around 10,000 people didn’t sound like my idea of fun. Attending an event that none - and I mean none - of my friends support also provided a moral barrier. I was born in Queensland, and from the age of 10 would watch The Cup on an old, boxy TV - placing imaginary bets in a hat with the hope of winning a bag of lollies. My understanding of what The Cup would actually entail only ever circled around binge drinking, big hats and celebrities.

On my way over to the Flemington racetrack, my Uber driver, a regular racegoer, affirms my suspicions, describing the event as “mad”. Small groups of police officers cluster as we get closer, and as we arrive at the main gate just before 10AM, he points out a small protest with a humoured giggle. I make him circle back so I can have a closer look.

It’s not a huge rally. About 20 people hold cardboard signs, brandishing the anti-Melbourne Cup slogan #nuptothecup. Electronic music vibrates across the sidewalk, a man's prerecorded voice incising every beat. “There is no retirement for horses,” he says. “Racing is cruelty.”

Racegoers enter through the track’s only entrance. Heads down, phones in hand, as a woman with a megaphone chases them chanting “Nup to the Cup.”

She introduces herself to me as Kristen Lee, from The Coalition for the Protection of Racehorses. “We’re here to raise awareness about the cruelty that is systemic in horse racing,” she says. “Horses are killed on race tracks, and they’re also killed when they’re no longer profitable. They’re basically seen as commodities; as investments for people to make money from through entertainment and gambling profits.”

Since 2013, only three Melbourne Cup races have passed without a horse fatality. Seven horses have died as a direct result of injuries sustained during the race in the last 9 years. The most recent was 2020’s Anthony Van Dyck, which broke down during the race. A report by Racing Victoria in the following months found the stallion had been administered a nerve block injection — an anaesthetic that selectively eliminates pain — a month before racing. With its death, Anthony Van Dyck joined a growing list of horses that has seen The Melbourne Cup labeled, statistically, “the world’s deadliest race.” Racing Victoria announced a new set of rules that saw more intensive screening and the use of bone or CT scans for all horses.

“We’re here till 1 o’clock today,” says Lee, “just as the main crowds come in, so that we can have a presence and be here in solidarity with the horses.”

Across the road, darting between cars, a number of protestors charge towards the entrance and into the waiting hands of police. It’s an intense scene as most, if not all, are apprehended, held to the ground or shoved. One man struggles as three officers pin him down with their knees on his back, handcuffs around his wrists.

I am ushered away by security guards, down the hill towards the main entrance which sits a few hundred metres away. The atmosphere almost immediately changes: a group of young men exit their cars, sunglasses tipped on the ends of their noses, yelling “HOW GOOD IS THIS!” as I watch them skull their beers.

A red helicopter flits in and out of a neighbouring helipad. Stretch limo’s litter the car park. Women in dainty flower dresses, carefully crafted hats and impossibly high heels stop to fill their Instagram feeds along the white rose-fitted archways that stretch towards the big event. Men with greased-back hair and sharp suits act as their photographers.

Kitchen workers, looking bored shitless, sit eating their lunch under the large camphaloral trees that sweep the main entrance. It’s 10:40 and I’m already sweating.

Of the 10,000 patrons allowed entry into this year’s Cup, 7,000 are allocated members of the Victoria Racing Club and 2500 for sponsorships and owners of competing horses. Only 500 are available for general admission. Depending on your pass, crowds are ushered through different coloured gates: purple, pink and green. While Green holds only a few members alongside the 500 extra ticket holders, pink and purple are exclusively members only. We are all factioned off, like a cattle yard, and I stand with the rest of the media in our own little section – a faction of a faction, waiting for things to happen.

The main crowd tickets are designated to certain areas, either in the stands or in the beer garden. There’s also an air-conditioned restaurant. Next door is The Grandstand - a member’s only purple area. Pre-set white tablecloths rest underneath glinting wine glasses, and walkways are adorned with red rope. White, middle-aged racegoers sit, moving in and out of the glass-panelled, air conditioned building behind them. I make a joke on Instagram to my close friends: “Someone please help. I haven’t seen one non-white person since I got here and I’m scared.”

A group of boys sit quietly next to me, clasping onto beer cans, watching the horses below. “What brought you guys here today, are you fans of the races?” I ask. They laugh awkwardly and one of them shrugs, “Uh, it’s just something to do, I guess.” They laze across a number of seats that in a normal year would be full.

In the beer garden nearby, hundreds of white tents decorate the grass. Subdued racegoers huddle around picnic tables, cans lining the chequered tablecloths, with some ogling over the black, iron fence of the parade ring to see the horses. Though the area is littered with young men in pressed white shirts, at times quadruple-fisting $10 beer cans from a nearby bar, the grass is near pristine. “You’re too drunk to go on the prowl aren’t you?” comes a voice from behind me. His mate replies, “Yeah, I think so.”

As I walk past the VIP stage, walled with security, I notice a girl in an outlandish white-feathered hat. She sips on a gin and tonic, her red lipstick staining the rim, “I’ve never actually been to The Cup, but I really want to see it live,” she said. “I love horses: the betting, the fashion, everything. It’s the only time you can dress like this - massive hat and heels and outrageous outfit - and it’s acceptable.”

“What about the ethics of it?” I ask her.

She takes a step back, “I’ve had horses growing up. I’ve worked in the industry. Trainers treat horses like their children; they’re so well looked after. Obviously, a horse's death is absolutely horrible, but that’s just one horse. People have accidents, animals have accidents, it’s one of those things that can’t be avoided.”

While 24 horses usually race in the Melbourne Cup’s big race, only 23 horses are set to approach the field this year. Irish horse Future Score was pulled after showing lameness in a mandatory inspection the day before.

Back in the seemingly empty stands I notice an older couple marking numbers on a white sheet of paper. ``“We've been coming to the cup together for 20 years,” says Jane, who pokes out from underneath a maroon top-hat. Terry shakes his head, a yellow flower in his pocket. He’s missing his bottom front teeth, “More than 20 years,” he says. ”Before that I’ve been coming since the mid 80’s.”

“Generally on Cup Day, it’s really packed out,” Jane tells me. “Too many people. I mean, this is lovely.”

When asked about the protests outside, she falters slightly. “Look, I absolutely understand, it is really tragic when horses have to be put down. There was a Cup a few years ago where a horse had to be put down. I mean, if you thought about it too much, you wouldn’t come. You want to have a nice outing and a nice thing to enjoy. I can’t see the whole industry closing down because of one death.”

As the time draws closer to three, Delta Goodrem appears in a pre-recorded performance on the track’s big screen. I’m surprised at first that she’s the cup’s chosen entertainment, considering I hadn’t listened to her music since it slapped when I was a kid. I had no idea she was still making it, but it seems fitting for an event slowly losing relevance. Later, she performs somewhere on the racecourse, but as I’m in the Green section, I have no idea where.

Then, the national anthem begins – sung by a performer from the Moulin Rouge, an upcoming musical to be performed around Australia. The jockeys, their international flags waving behind them, stand in line, shoulder-to-shoulder in the Parade Ring. A few minutes later the horses arrive, twitching and kicking, and the commentator mentions something about them feeling the heat.

I hear punters in the stands chatting about their bets. The favourite to win today is Incentivise, described as “the second coming of Phar Lap”. It’s hard not to give in to the growing adrenaline, the most excitement I’ve felt all day, as the horses make their way to the starting line. It’s a collective symptom of most big sporting events. My chest starts to thud, my hands get slightly sweaty and I lean forward slightly in my chair. I sit in a corner surrounded by a few empty seats.

The gates open and the horses leap. Men behind me scream and wave their hats: “Get bloody in front Incentivise!”

I see the horse’s noses flare, the jockey’s garments rippling in the wind. I see whips smacking flanks and uprooted grass springing metres into the air. As they move around the corner, a clear winner begins to emerge: it’s not Incentivise, much to just about every punter’s disappointment.

Instead, Verry Elleegant, a New Zealand-born thoroughbred, wins by a large margin. Incentivise finishes second, and later the public are told the once-favourite suffered injuries: a swelling in his near foreleg. Veterinarians continue to monitor the situation, and the industry holds its breath.

As soon as the race starts, it’s over. Punters quickly leave their seats and the crowd below thins. It’s a quiet evacuation on a particularly quiet day. There are no drunk men in wheelie bins, no passed out women in gowns. Just 10,000 privileged racegoers, a few more privileged than the rest."

Almost a year after the Capitol riot, anti-vaccine mandate protesters in New Zealand attempted to storm the country’s parliament on Tuesday. And just like at the riot in Washington D.C. on January 6, many of those protesting were waving American flags, supporting former President Trump, and spouting QAnon conspiracies.

QAnon played a central role in the attack on the Capitol, and even though the conspiracy theory is based entirely on U.S. politics and politicians, the movement has found a home in almost 100 countries, including New Zealand.

Protests took place across New Zealand on Tuesday, organized by anti-vaxxer groups critical of the vaccine mandate introduced by Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern and her government. The biggest protest took place in the capital Wellington on Tuesday, which saw thousands of protesters descend on the parliament in scenes eerily reminiscent of the attack on the Capitol.

Prior to the protests on Tuesday, organizers had urged those attending to storm the parliament building. “A group of 1000 people can storm in and get her and her supporters and arrest them for treason,” a user in one Telegram group used to organize the protest wrote. “Or shoot them. If we don’t have guns, shoot them up with a triple dose of Pfizer.”

On Tuesday, while protesters didn’t manage to get inside the parliament building, some protesters in Wellington allegedly grabbed and pushed a cameraman, and threw tennis balls with “Hang Ardern” at the building. In Auckland, a protester allegedly bit a police officer.

The similarities with the Capitol Riots were all the more real thanks to the presence of QAnon supporters, who revealed to local media that while they had adopted the U.S. conspiracy theory, they had also given it a local twist.

One group of QAnon supporters told Stuff that Ardern was involved in child sex trafficking and that she had actually been arrested during a visit to the White House in 2019 and she was now wearing an ankle bracelet to track her movements.

One supporter said the arrest came after Ardern signed some document that authorized China to spy on former President Donald Trump. “That’s an act of war, brother,” the unnamed QAnon supporter said.

Though Ardern did meet Trump in 2019, the meeting took place in New York on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly. There is no indication that Ardern ever signed any document to authorize spying on Trump.

As has been the case elsewhere, QAnon took hold in New Zealand at the same time as the country enacted a hugely restrictive country-wide lockdown as it sought to reach a zero-COVID state. The country was one of the first to shut its borders to all international visitors in March 2020, only allowing residents to return if they agreed to complete two weeks of hotel quarantine first. While New Zealand briefly opened a travel bubble with Australia earlier this year, that was subsequently shut down again in response to a spike caused by the delta variant.

QAnon conspiracies quickly merged with other conspiracy theories, including claims that vaccinations were part of a population control effort and claims that 5G cell towers were spreading COVID-19.

In the past, many non-U.S. QAnon groups have dramatically changed the conspiracy theories to their specific sociopolitical and cultural environments. As QAnon emerged from fringe websites like 8chan, early adopters took the messages posted by the anonymous leader Q and interpreted or decoded them to fit their own narratives.

But in Wellington on Tuesday, the QAnon supporters were waving Trump flags, suggesting they had bought into the narrative coming out of the U.S. wholesale.

“Now that QAnon communities are as often disconnected from its originating chan culture, as they are connected to it, we can see that those who were not part of the participatory decoding process take QAnon narratives much more at face value,” Marc Andre Argentino, a researcher who tracks extremist groups, tweeted.

It’s unclear as of yet whether this change in the way QAnon is exported globally at face value is more or less dangerous than adapting it, but Argentino believes that “for some of the more antisemitic or violent narratives in QAnon, this can be more harmful, whereas in other instances it is simply absurd.”"

The segment is five minutes long but is entirely about the family grocery shopping. CNN host Brianna Keilar teased the segment in a tweet with a quote from the Stotlers that claimed a gallon of milk has gone from $1.99 to $2.79 recently and, because the large family buys 12 gallons of milk a week, “that’s a lot of money.”

The CNN segment is striking a nerve online in part because ""12 gallons of milk a week"" is an eye-popping number (the Stotlers have nine kids, they say), and in part because people have been obsessed with inflation over the last several months, and whether or not it is ""transitory""—that is, a short-term situation caused by supply chain disruptions, the reopening of the economy after COVID-19 lockdowns, and the general rebound to ""normal"" after a year in which economic activity was depressed for several months. The Consumer Price Index shows people are indeed paying more for a lot of items, especially for used cars (a result of the shortage in new cars) and gas (which was at abnormally low prices last year). But the milk example makes no sense, because the price of milk has barely risen.

There is some consternation online about whether the $1.99 and $2.79 numbers are correct (the average cost of a gallon of milk has not been as low as $1.99 in several decades). It’s certainly possible that the Stotlers got a gallon of milk for $1.99 at some point on sale, and the $2.79 price as of today is what a gallon of Kroger-brand 2 percent milk costs at the Texas store shown in the CNN clip, according to Kroger’s website.

If the Stotlers’ milk price increase really was due to inflation, that would be a 40 percent jump. Indeed, that would be big, if true, as they say. But that is not what is happening with dairy prices. Ironically, dairy is actually benefiting from among the lowest rates of inflation at the moment, with the BLS reporting dairy prices have risen just .6 percent over the last 12 months. That’s actually slightly less than the targeted annual inflation.

If the price of a gallon of milk actually increased 80 cents, that would result in the Stotlers spending 38 dollars more a month on milk, to be precise. But, like most everything else the Stotlers say about food prices in the segment, it is not backed up by inflation data.

While it is certainly possible the Stotlers recently bought a gallon of milk for $1.99 and now the gallon of milk costs $2.79, this doesn’t mean the price difference is due to inflation. Milk prices are generally volatile, with some regions like Florida more prone to milk prices being all over the place than places like New York. It also follows a distinctly seasonal pattern, according to researchers at the Cornell Program on Dairy Markets and Policy, with prices rising in the fall and declining in the spring.

But it’s not just about milk. While food prices are increasing, they’re not doing so at an especially alarming rate. According to the most recent Consumer Price Index released by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, food prices have indeed gone up a bit, with grocery store prices up 4.5 percent year over year. A healthy rate of inflation is typically regarded as around one to two percent. But it’s also far from crisis levels. By way of comparison, food prices rose 20 percent in 1973 and 12 percent in 1974.

Still, even if the Stotlers aren’t quite getting inflation right, they’re inadvertently getting another economic measure spot on, a metric called Consumer Sentiment. It is a survey the Federal Reserve conducts to find out how people are feeling about the economy. This may sound frivolous for the serious business of measuring the economic health of the U.S., but it’s an important metric. If people are optimistic, they will typically spend more, especially big-ticket items like new houses and cars and vacations, because they feel good about their ability to pay it off. If they’re pessimistic, they might be more hesitant to do so, which is bad for the economy. Consumer Sentiment is really low right now, about the same level it was in April 2020 when most Americans were in some form of lockdown.

The Stotlers may be wrong about the significance of random milk price fluctuations, but their angst over inflation and the general state of the economy is shared by millions of other Americans. That collective angst is affecting not just the outcomes of elections but also the economy as a whole."

Now, it's going to war for Trumpism.",https://www.vice.com/en/article/qjb4y3/john-eastman-claremont-institute-supporting-jan-6-trumpism,2021-11-04T17:37:35Z,"As Vice President Mike Pence and his team hid in the basement of the Capitol from rioters chanting “Hang Mike Pence” on Jan. 6, President Donald Trump’s attorney John Eastman emailed one of Pence’s s… [+28924 chars]",Left,"“The ‘siege’ is because YOU and your boss did not do what was necessary to allow this to be aired in a public way so that the American people can see for themselves what happened,” Eastman told Pence adviser Greg Jacob.

As Vice President Mike Pence and his team hid in the basement of the Capitol from rioters chanting “Hang Mike Pence” on Jan. 6, President Donald Trump’s attorney John Eastman emailed one of Pence’s staffers to blame him for the violence.

Claremont Institute leaders’ actions leading up to, during, and after Jan. 6 are the culmination of five years of increasingly alarmist rhetoric and calls to action from the think tank, whose embrace of Trump and Trumpism have helped mainstream fringe views into the Republican Party ecosystem by positioning themselves as the vanguard in an existential “ cold civil war ” between true Americans and anti-American progressives.

“Have been on Capitol Hill all day. We are in a constitutional crisis and also in a revolutionary moment,” Brian Kennedy, the president emeritus and senior fellow at the Claremont Institute, tweeted on Jan. 5. “We must embrace the spirit of the American Revolution to stop this communist revolution. #HoldTheLine.”

And he wasn’t the only Claremont Institute leader involved in that harrowing episode—and in subsequent efforts to undermine democracy.

Eastman, the director of the Claremont Institute’s Center for Constitutional Jurisprudence, is also the man who wrote the memo that said Pence should try to block Biden’s election certification.

The insurrection came after Trump, with Eastman’s help, tried to bully Pence into blocking Congress from certifying President-elect Joe Biden’s election win—what Jacob called “bullshit” legal advice that had left them “under siege”—then whipped his supporters into a frenzy that led to the violent ransacking of the U.S. Capitol.

It’s unclear exactly what the Claremont Institute’s leaders are up to now—Eastman, Kennedy, and Williams didn’t respond to multiple requests for comment for this story. But it appears they have been deeply involved in ongoing state-level efforts to install Republicans who believe the election was stolen in positions of power and change the rules before the next election.

Another lamented that “Claremont has bought in hard with this program of catastrophization—and that was an abrupt shift that happened the same time as the Trumpward shift.”

The extremism rhetoric espoused by some at the institute now also makes some former affiliates cringe. One warned the ongoing attacks on Americans’ trust in elections “could lead to more distrust and division and skepticism about various institutions in the medium-to-long run.”

“It’s incredibly concerning. They’re desperate to take on the role of leading the charge in terms of providing arguments for the anti-democratic populism of Trump. They really want to do everything they can to keep Republicans in power, even if it means manipulating through bad-faith measures the levers of power,” said Laura K. Field, a political theorist at the Niskanen Center and American University.

As Claremont Institute President Ryan Williams sums it up : “The mission of the Claremont Institute is to save Western civilization.”

Eastman was a late addition to Trump’s final inner circle of strategists, huddling day after day at the Willard Hotel with Giuliani, former White House Chief of Staff Steve Bannon, and others. On Jan. 2, he participated in a call with Trump and Republican state lawmakers to try to convince them to overturn their states’ election results.

Eastman didn’t mention that day that he’d crafted a scheme for Pence to do just that, with his now-infamous pair of memos to the vice president. Eastman, the former dean of Chapman University’s law school who had once clerked on the Supreme Court for Justice Clarence Thomas, claimed it was “fact” that the vice president was the “ultimate arbiter” of the Electoral College count and should reject the votes of a number of states in an attempt to throw the election to Trump. Or, at least, give Republicans in the swing states Trump lost one last chance to nominate alternate slates of electors that could have led to the same final result—and a constitutional crisis.

“It is the very essence of our republican form of government and it has to be done.”

“All we are demanding of Vice President Pence is this afternoon at 1 o’clock he let the legislators of the state look into this so we get to the bottom of it and the American people know whether we have control of the direction of our government or not,” Eastman thundered. “We no longer live in a self-governing republic if we can’t get the answer to this question. This is bigger than President Trump. It is the very essence of our republican form of government and it has to be done. And anybody that is not willing to stand up and do it does not deserve to be in the office.”

Eastman began lying immediately. He claimed “dead people voted” and “machines contributed to that fraud” by “unloading the ballots from the secret folder,” a reference to the debunked conspiracy theory that Dominion voting machines were rigged against Trump.

Shortly before Trump spoke on Jan. 6, Rudy Giuliani brought Eastman onstage, introducing him as “one of the preeminent constitutional scholars in the United States.”

At a recent QAnon conference , Nevada secretary of state candidate Jim Marchant said Kennedy had been at the first meeting of a new “coalition” of like-minded candidates to “control the election system” by winning secretary of state offices in key states. Also present were wealthy, conspiracy theory–funding MyPillow CEO Mike Lindell and Overstock.com founder Patrick Byrne, both of whom had encouraged Trump to declare martial law and have spent millions pushing “audits” since the election. Two Trump-endorsed candidates have since joined the effort.

Eastman seemed to confirm Williams’ statement: “My role is to identify as fully as we can what went on in order to prevent it from happening again,” he told the same undercover activist.

“John’s point has always been, look, unless we get right what happened in 2020, there’s no moving on. They’re just going to steal every subsequent election,” Williams said.

The institute’s Trump supporters have remained busy since the election. Williams, the president of the institute, recently told an undercover Democratic activist that Eastman is “still very involved with a lot of the state legislators.”

When they balked, he turned to Pence to buy them time. Pence refused; Eastman complained that the vice president was “an establishment guy” who wanted Trump to fail. According to Eastman, the Jan. 6 riots were instigated by “FBI plants” and the best way forward for the country would be to defeat all the Republican lawmakers who didn’t fight for Trump. Kennedy made a similar claim: On Jan. 7, Kennedy falsely said the rally was “hijacked by ANTIFA.”

He argued in September that Democrats were “openly talking about staging a coup,” claiming that a bipartisan group who’d met to game out what might happen if Trump refused to leave office was really planning a coup against Trump themselves. That conspiracy theory had floated around on far-right websites for weeks, but Anton supercharged and mainstreamed it: His essay was seen on Facebook almost 5 million times , and it was quickly parroted on larger right-wing outlets.

Michael Anton, a Claremont Institute senior fellow and a former senior staffer on Trump’s National Security Council, also played a key role in mainstreaming the conspiracy theory that Democrats were planning to steal the election last fall.

“It’s clear in Arizona that that election should have never been certified. I think you’re going to find the same thing in Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, and elsewhere,” Kennedy replied. “If we keep at it and don’t back up and keep finding and explaining to people all those illegal votes, the only logical thing for the legislature to do is to decertify the election. That’s the just thing to do.”

In a recent interview on his podcast, Bannon described Kennedy as “one of the architects” of Arizona’s deeply partisan and flawed pseudo-audit of Maricopa County’s electors, before asking him what should be done.

The work Eastman, Kennedy, Anton, and their compatriots are undertaking is far removed from the origin of their academic think tank—though there are some ideological through-lines.

He went even further in May, holding a two-hour conversation on his podcast with a neo-monarchist Curtis Yarvin about whether the United States needs an “American Caesar” to seize power. Anton didn’t endorse Yarvin’s push, but he didn’t exactly condemn it either.

The day after Trump lost, Anton falsely claimed that key swing states had “stopped the count” of votes to rig things against Trump. And after the Capitol riots, Anton blamed Jan. 6 on “the ruling class’s decades-long betrayal and despoliation of what would eventually come to be called Red or Deplorable or Flyover America.” He pushed Trump’s big lie, claiming, “There are reasons to doubt” the election, and blamed the “one-party oligarchy” that was “the nemesis of the Trump presidency” for not listening to the patriots who had valid concerns about “a country flooded with immigration for more than half a century, padding the votes of the other party, driving down wages, and enriching oligarchs.”

A major part of the Claremont Institute is its fellowship programs , including Lincoln Fellowships for young professionals and Publius Fellowships for recent college graduates, who’ve gone on to play a major role in modern conservatism. Alumni include establishment-minded conservatives like former George W. Bush administration official Tevi Troy, University of New Hampshire professor Dante Scala, and right-leaning journalists like New York Times columnist Ross Douthat, Washington Free Beacon Editor-in-Chief and Politico alum Eliana Johnson, along with more activist shit-stirrers like right-wing provocateur and filmmaker Dinesh D’Souza, whose jail sentence for campaign finance violations was shortened by a pardon from Trump.

Jaffa’s influence is wide and deep in conservatism—he was a close friend of and influence on National Review founder William F. Buckley, and influenced heavy-hitters including Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas, who regularly quotes Jaffa .

The Claremont Institute was created in 1979 in suburban Los Angeles by Claremont McKenna College professor Harry Jaffa, a former speechwriter for 1964 Republican presidential nominee Barry Goldwater, student of the political philosopher Leo Strauss, and author of a well-respected book on the Lincoln-Douglas debates. Jaffa wrote Goldwater’s famous convention line , “Extremism in the defense of liberty is no vice.”

Arkansas Republican Sen. Tom Cotton, a 1997 Lincoln Fellow and potential presidential aspirant, used his keynote address at their 2018 gala to blast the “cosmopolitan elite” for putting “its own interests and the interests of foreigners above the national interest” by supporting immigration—familiar themes for the think tank.

Many former fellows have gone on to be major influences in the GOP—including Fox News host and anti-immigration culture warrior Laura Ingraham and Daily Wire founder and former Breitbart editor Ben Shapiro.

(The Claremont Institute has no direct ties to Claremont McKenna College, the Claremont Graduate University, or any of the other Claremont schools. Full disclosure: I graduated from CMC and knew some of those involved in the institute.)

“Charge the cockpit or you die,” the essay proclaimed , warning “We are headed off a cliff” due to “a tidal wave of dysfunction, immorality, and corruption” from the left as well as “the ceaseless importation of Third World foreigners with no tradition of, taste for, or experience in liberty.”

Multiple former scholars say that turn happened quickly as Trump locked up the Republican nomination in the spring of 2016. But it got wider notice late that summer when an anonymous author going by the pseudonym “Publius” issued an essay titled “The Flight 93 Election.”

What’s clear is that the institute’s leaders, and their traditional focus, has changed.

The institute is debuting a new Sheriffs Fellowship in 2021, where officers will study topics including natural law, progressivism, and “the roots of radical leftist ideology.”

The Claremont Institute’s recent fellowships have largely gone to a new breed of right-wingers.

Its recent crop of Publius Fellows , a three-week fellowship for younger professionals and recent college grads, includes junior staffers for combative and conspiracy-minded Georgia Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene and Missouri Republican Sen. Josh Hawley, who led the charge against certifying Biden’s election win in the Senate.

Jaffa wasn’t exactly an exemplar of temperate rhetoric, however. He and other West Coast Straussians long argued that America is facing a “progressive revolt against the founding” starting with President Woodrow Wilson’s “administrative state” (a precursor to worries about the “deep state”).

""The Claremont Institute spent 36 years as a resolutely anti-populist institution, [and] preached rightly that norms and institutions were hard to build and easy to destroy, so to watch them suddenly embrace Trump in May 2016 was like if PETA suddenly published a barbecue cookbook,” that fellow told VICE News.

One former Claremont Institute Lincoln Fellow told VICE News that watching the staid academic institute, which they’d once so admired, suddenly morph into an organization bent on defending Trumpism and fanning the flames of civilizational alarmism at the expense of all else “was like ‘The Invasion of the Body Snatchers.’”

Two former contributors to the Claremont Review of Books, the institute’s flagship publication, told VICE News that they decided to stop writing for it after the institute took its sudden pro-Trump turn in mid-2016.

Some former Claremont Institute allies are aghast at what they see as a departure from Jaffa’s vision and a shift toward authoritarianism and demagoguery.

Rush Limbaugh read the piece in its entirety on his show, and it quickly went viral on the right. It was later revealed that the piece was written by Anton, a former speechwriter for Giuliani and Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice who by then was working in the Trump administration.

“The ideal endgame would be to effect a realignment of our politics and take control of all three branches of government for a generation or two,” he said.

Williams, the institute’s president, recently told the Atlantic that “the Constitution is really only fit for a Christian people.” And while he said a civil war should be “the thing we try to avoid almost at all costs,” he made clear that a peaceful defeat wasn’t acceptable—while laying out the Claremont Institute’s endgame.

""The Claremont Institute spent 36 years as a resolutely anti-populist institution, [and] preached rightly that norms and institutions were hard to build and easy to destroy, so to watch them suddenly embrace Trump in May 2016 was like if PETA suddenly published a barbecue cookbook.”

But even those polemics are milquetoast when compared to the Claremont Institute’s current leaders.

Jaffa argued global environmentalism was akin to socialism, said political correctness was “the blind and willful insistence upon the fulfillment of the goals of revolutionary Marxism/Leninism,” and was deeply homophobic, regularly referring to gay people as “sodomites.”

“They see America as fragile in a way that other Straussians don’t,” another former Claremont Institute Lincoln Fellow told VICE News.

Klingenstein argued in a recent speech that America has entered a “cold civil war” between true patriots and “woke communists” who are hellbent on the “destruction of the American way of life.” He claimed that the real “big lie” is that America is racist, and says that the 2020 elections were marred by “enough evidence of fraud” that he doesn’t trust their results.

The chairman of the board of the Claremont Institute, investment banker Thomas Klingenstein , has in recent years become a major Republican donor. He gave $3 million to the Trump-aligned group the Club for Growth and another $500,000 to the hard-right American Principles Project in 2020 alone, on top of max-out donations to a bevy of GOP House and Senate candidates. He’s already donated another half-million dollars to the Club for Growth this year as well as more than $100,000 to candidates—most of them ardent Trump supporters.

Arthur Milikh, the executive director of the Claremont Institute’s D.C.-based Center for the American Way of Life, recently argued that America is in the middle of “a regime-level struggle” between “the American way of life” and “identity politics.”

A few weeks later, Arizona Republican Rep. Paul Gosar, who has ties to white supremacist groups, made headlines with the claim that the Capitol officer “appeared to be hiding, lying in wait and then gave no warning before killing her.” Soon afterward, Trump publicly adopted her as a martyr to his movement—a key aspect of the right-wing rewriting of the history of Jan. 6.

Capitol rioter Ashli Babbitt’s death from a Capitol policeman’s bullet made her an immediate martyr in neo-Nazi and QAnon circles, but Codevilla was one of the first reputable conservatives to paint her as a victim, writing in May that her killing was “an obviously indefensible act.”

Shortly before the last election, Codevilla said conservatives should form armed “self-defense groups” and give police “lively reasons to fear you.”

That “cold civil war” framing seems to have been coined in 2017 by Angelo Codevilla, a Claremont Institute senior fellow and major figure at Claremont until his death in September. He was an early intellectual enemy of what he called the “ruling class”—rhetoric embraced by conservative heavyweights like Limbaugh that presaged Trumpism by years.

“There simply can be no peace between woke communism and America,” he said. “The essential thing I've tried to stress is for Republicans to understand we are in a war and then act accordingly. War is not a time for too much civility, compromise, or for imputing good motives to the enemy. Our generals must fight as if the choice was between liberty and death.”

For years, Eastman has argued that the 14th Amendment doesn’t actually guarantee citizenship to “All persons born or naturalized in the United States,” as the amendment clearly states, but only those born here to parents who are citizens or legal permanent residents. His first salvo on this came back in 2006, and he and other Claremont scholars, including Anton , have championed the argument ever since.

Eastman reportedly first got on Trump’s radar in 2019 with a Fox News appearance where he lambasted the Russia investigation. Trump soon invited him to the White House, and not long after that, set up a meeting between Eastman and Attorney General Bill Barr so Eastman could lay out his claim that Trump could unilaterally limit birthright citizenship.

“Many Claremonsters have the ear of this administration and may help Trump take what he feels in his gut and migrate it to his head,” Klingenstein, the chairman of the board, boasted in a 2017 speech introducing Supreme Court Justice Samuel Alito.

The Jan. 6 memos weren’t the first time Trump took his cues from the Claremont Institute.

When the Claremont Institute held its annual gala last week, Florida Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis, arguably the most popular leader in the GOP besides Trump, name-checked Codevilla to applause , then framed his speech around attacking the “ruling class” that Codevilla spent his late career railing against, while attendees cheered him on at the $400-a-plate event.

Trump amplified that message, questioning Harris’ citizenship and cited the “very highly qualified” Eastman to back up his point.

“Many Claremonsters have the ear of this administration and may help Trump take what he feels in his gut and migrate it to his head.”

Eastman took this one step further in 2020, arguing that then-Sen. Kamala Harris might not be eligible to be vice president if her parents weren’t lawful permanent residents at the time of her birth.

Eastman’s claim was embraced by Trump in 2018 , who told Axios he was considering an executive order to end birthright citizenship for immigrants.

Johnson has since broken with the Claremont Institute. “ I am horrified by the kind of Claremont caesarism that encouraged those rioters to descend upon the Capitol,” Johnson wrote in October, calling the institute’s ideas “both dangerous and contemptuous” and arguing Eastman “all but provided the arguments for an American putsch.”

“Beattie’s offense is that he spoke at an event where—gasp!—there were white nationalists afoot!” Johnson emailed the group . “Heaven forbid that some thinkers—like the American founders who favored our country be majority white—think that the U.S. of A should stay majority white! Perish the thought. Can’t have that.”

When Beattie asked for help in lobbying to his defense on a Claremont Institute listserv, he got it from former Claremont Institute fellow Charles Johnson, a Holocaust denier and one-time protegé of Bannon’s who has ties with a number of Republican congressmen in Trump’s orbit.

Former Lincoln Fellow Darren Beattie was a Trump White House speechwriter—until he was fired for speaking at a white nationalist conference.

The Trump administration responded by commissioning the 1776 Commission —a rebuke of the New York Times’ 1619 Project —a work that received heavy input from people connected to the Claremont Institute. The commission’s chairman, Larry Arnn, is vice chairman of the Claremont Institute's board of directors and former president of the institute as well as president of the conservative Hillsdale College; the program’s executive director, Matthew Spalding, is another Claremont Institute fellow and Hillsdale professor. Claremont McKenna Review of Books editor and Claremont McKenna College professor Charles Kesler was one of its main authors.

Just weeks after George Floyd’s murder at the hands of a Minneapolis police officer set off a national wave of protest, the Claremont Institute put out an official statement from Klingenstein and Williams that called the Black Lives Matter movement a “revolutionary and totalitarian movement ” bent on “the destruction of the American way of life.” They went further, calling the protests a “nationwide riot” that were the “handiwork of the elite.”

Beattie has also played a key role in promoting the conspiracy theory that the Jan. 6 attacks were a false flag operation orchestrated by the FBI. He’s been on Tucker Carlson’s Fox News show multiple times to push that debunked theory, and claims the deep state is “coming after half the country” in Carlson’s new “documentary” about Jan. 6.

Beattie worked for a stint with Florida Republican Rep. Matt Gaetz. As rioters hit the Capitol on Jan. 6 he tweeted that various Black leaders needed to “learn their place” and “take a knee to MAGA.” Williams touted Beattie’s work the next day in a since-deleted tweet .

(Alex Wroblewski / Bloomberg via Getty Images)

Around the time the 1776 Commission’s report was released, Trump awarded the Claremont Institute with the prestigious National Humanities Medal, where Williams was honored alongside actor Jon Voight, musician Allison Krauss, and author James Patterson.

“One of America’s leading think tanks, the Claremont Institute has made invaluable contributions to the history of American conservative thought,” Trump said. “Claremont educates, reminds, and informs Americans about the founding principles that have made our country the greatest nation anywhere on Earth. Through publications, seminars, and scholarship, they fight to ‘recover the American idea.’ I know it well.”

Trump, of course, isn’t going anywhere. He’s signaled he’ll run again in 2024, and is working to strong-arm the GOP into embracing and centering his election lies by endorsing lackeys and threatening dissidents, while increasingly defending the rioters he sicced on Congress on Jan. 6.

“The insurrection took place on November 3, Election Day. January 6 was the Protest!” Trump declared last week.

These beliefs have bled into the GOP mainstream. Almost one-third of Republicans agreed that “Because things have gotten so far off track, true American patriots may have to resort to violence in order to save our country” in a recent PRRI poll, including 40% who most trust far-right news. More than two-thirds of Republicans say the election was stolen from Trump.

The American Political Science Association decided to convert the Claremont Institute’s planned panels at their September conference from in-person to online because of concerns about safety, spurring the institute to cancel them altogether. The Claremont Institute is now threatening to sue.

And Eastman’s facing a potentially more serious problem: The House select committee investigating Jan. 6 plans to subpoena him.

But other mainstream conservatives are still happy to embrace the institute.

Williams, Anton, Klingenstein, and other Claremont Institute figures all spoke at this week at NatCon, a major gathering of conservative intellectuals in Orlando that was headlined by Hawley, Cruz, and Florida Sen. Marco Rubio—all potential future presidential aspirants.

Anton remains a talking head in good stead on the right—Laura Ingraham, another former Claremont fellow, had him on her Fox News show just a few weeks ago to discuss his view that there’s a cultural and economic “war between the states.”

“Overturning the existing post-American order, and re-establishing America’s ancient principles in practice, is a sort of counter-revolution, and the only road forward.”

Last spring, Tucker Carlson brought on Claremont Institute Senior Fellow Glenn Ellmers to talk about an article where he claimed “most people living in the United States today—certainly more than half—are not Americans in any meaningful sense of the term.”

Ellmers argued in the piece that “the U.S. Constitution no longer works,” called his foes “citizen-aliens” and “non-American Americans,” and compared those that don’t agree with him to a “zombie or a human rodent.”

And he neatly summed up the role that many at the Claremont Institute seem to see for themselves going forward.



“Paradoxically, the organization that has been uniquely devoted to understanding and teaching the principles of the American founding now sees with special clarity why ‘conserving’ that legacy is a dead end,” he wrote. “Overturning the existing post-American order, and re-establishing America’s ancient principles in practice, is a sort of counter-revolution, and the only road forward.”

And Eastman, Kennedy, Anton, Klingenstein, Williams, and the rest of the Claremont Institute seem ready to wage that fight."

They just don’t make movie swag like they used to. While promotional material still exists for big blockbuster releases, marketing giveaways and cheesy memorabilia has sadly become a relic of the past, alongside toys in cereal boxes and going to the mall to just hangout. But our nostalgia for those halcyon days persists, and A24 wants to celebrate that bygone era of movie magic with a new book all about the best props, swag and marketing mayhem from Hollywood.



Released today, For Promotional Use Only: A Catalogue of Hollywood Movie Swag and Promo Merch from 1975-2000 (a mouthful!) is a fan letter to the aesthetics of cinephilia and the absurd lengths production studios would go to in order to generate buzz for their movies in an era pre-Twitter.

Featuring everything from hats, coffee mugs, pens, clocks, mouse pads and toy guns, the high-end coffee table book is a celebration of ingenuity and excess in the film industry. It showcases a mammoth 165 artefacts of cinema, with notable chefs kiss examples including Jaws beach bags (with matching tights), a surprisingly chic silk jacket in the actual Colour Purple, a Mr Bean mouse-mat, a Wilson-faced Castaway volleyball and a bag of magic beans that may or may not grow into evil creatures when dropped in water (to coincide with the release of Gremlins 2). Other more bizarre items include a set of Being John Malkovic-themed Russian nesting dolls, a Reservoir Dogs branded plastic ear, a Jackass whoopee cushion, a newspaper reporting dispatches from inside Jurassic Park and a bucket hat inspired by The Notebook.

As well as the memorabilia itself, For Promotional Use Only… also features essays and insights from some of the people who brought us the most bizarre and imaginative items (notably Steve Ellman, the mind behind the Jaws beach bag). There’s also a foreword by Roger Corman, a legendary actor, director and producer known as “The Pope of Pop Cinema”.



To celebrate the book’s release, A24 is organising a charity auction of some of the best and most bizarro movie merch from the past. Utilising their charity auction platform, A24 Auctions, the sale will feature all of the objects featured in the new book, with proceeds going towards the Vidiots Foundation, a charity supporting the reopening of LA’s historic Eagles Theatre in Spring 2022.

It’s not the first time A24 have dipped their toes into the prop auctioneering game. At the beginning of the pandemic, the company organised a charity auction of the most iconic props from their own movies and shows, including the Midsommar floral dress, Rue’s trademark red hoodie from Euphoria and Adam Sandler’s chic Furby necklace from Uncut Gems, all in aid of organisations in New York leading the fight against Covid-19.



If you missed out that first time round (or you just want a Vin Diesel xXx emblazoned condom to add to your Furby necklace -- May Queen dress ensemble), then the auction runs from 4 November until the end of this week. Happy bidding!

Over a phone call from Cape Town, he describes how burglars broke into the house he and his family are staying in last night, meaning he got very little sleep. A little trepidatious, yet enthusiastic to discuss work that hasn't yet been discussed, he quickly launches in: ""Let's give it a bash and see how it goes.""

Composed entirely of studio-shot portraits — mostly headshots, though some are full-body and completely nude — at first glance this project feels like a shift for Pieter. Or, at least, a refinement. Here we find little more than a camera, a model, and a studio. There are no dramatic landscapes or latent symbolism, like the kind found in La Cucaracha, his contemplation of life and death in Mexico that was exhibited just before the pandemic, or the bulk of his archive. Yet all his subjects bear the signature Pieter Hugo gaze – a piercing look that bores deep inside you – found anywhere he turns his lens: in Mexican snake charmers; Jamaican porn stars; Nollywood actors; his children; himself. Holding the gaze of different models – cast by the agency Midland in Paris, London, New York, Cape Town and Johannesburg – with little else to distract or disarm, the effect is even more startling.

DONOVAN, NEW YORK, 2020

Originating from a journalistic background and shifting into the role of an art practitioner as his career passed, Pieter's popularity and assignments from fashion brands and magazines took him somewhat by surprise a few years ago. Looking at the work fashion is so keen to tap into and reproduce right now, that of Kyle Weeks, Rahim Fortune, Kristin Lee-Moolman, Sam Rock, Jackie Nickerson, for example, a tension between fact and fiction seems present. Pieter, who began shooting in the early 90s, has interrogated this method of image-making. So perhaps Solus Vol. I could be viewed as a pared-back version of what Pieter has always been trying to say with his work. As he himself puts it, ""I'm concerned with people and their appearance. I'm a portraitist. What people are wearing and how they present themselves is at the core of my work.""

Shot between 2019 and 2021, this project was first conceived two years earlier, on the set of a fashion shoot commissioned by M, Le magazine du Monde. Looking at the polaroids of the different models pinned up on the wall on set, it struck Pieter that the faces looking back at him were far more interesting than the ones that had gone through the ""machinations"" of the fashion industry – i.e. the hair and makeup and styling – and ended up in front of his camera. From there, he and Walter and Rachel of Midland, who had cast this M story, began discussing what could become of this idea. ""In a certain way, I guess, the work has been ahead of me,"" Pieter says. ""I'm still catching up to it because there was an impulse to make the work, but I didn't really know what about it was compelling. It's taken me a couple of years to catch up to that impulse. So we started photographing.""

ALAN, PARIS, 2019

Pieter began in Paris, then London, and then New York. But, as with any ongoing project that commenced two years ago, Covid brought everything to a halt. Around the same time, he began questioning his role – the exchange between photographer and model – at such a tense moment, socially and politically. The pandemic was raging, and ""the Black Lives Matter protests were happening,"" Pieter says. ""I felt like, as a white male, it was a good time to just shut up and listen and not a good time to put out work. I took a long break, a hiatus from this series, and when I felt a bit more even-keeled, I reached out to Rachel and Walter and said, 'I think we should start working on this again'."" Travel was still impossible due to South Africa's strict border policy and Red List status. ""But they said, 'Well actually, as it turns out, one of Walter's really good friends who's done casting for him happens to be stuck in South Africa as well.' And I thought, okay, let's expand this to Cape Town and Johannesburg. Just disrupt the narrative from the obvious fashion centres.""

When I spoke with Pieter last about a story he made of his family in lockdown during this downtime, mid-2020, these concerns with his place in photography were particularly raw. He was very reflective – so I ask if he can trace those changes or contemplations he had over that period in this particular work. ""I don't know if it is, in this series, such a strong relationship to the shifts that occurred during that period,"" he says. But this series does say something about his past, and how he once looked to the future, he adds. ""I came out of this 1994 era of South Africa getting liberated, and there was this incredible naive optimism at that time, which is subsequently falling apart. And always in post-revolution, it's the scum that rises to the top. I guess in this project, in this era, within this epoch of strangeness and inclusivity, it's just refreshing to have a reiteration of that, I think. It kind of just reminded me of what I identified with and what I wanted the world to be when I was younger.""

KAREENA, NEW YORK, 2020

When asked about what that feels like now, living in South Africa, Pieter references the country as part of the ""New World"". ""It doesn't have the historical baggage to what a country like the UK or France will have,"" he says. ""And what you also have is, when we had those elections, there was immense goodwill globally and locally to make things work. And a major readjustment for people to be inclusive, to be tolerant, to accept things like gay marriage -- we had it written into our constitution. You know, it was an incredibly liberal experiment. Which, and as much as I identify with it, didn't quite play out the way I think the architects of it had envisaged it to. But the premise of it I still very much agree with and identify with.""

""I'm still figuring this project out,"" Pieter adds. ""For something that's so simple -- it's just portraits of people against a white background, how much more simple could it get really -- but I'm still figuring out what it's about."" There's plenty more to say about these images beyond what we've discussed – the ""hybridisation, or the convergence, of people's heritage that can be examined via a portrait"" for example, ""and how the environment, whether it's through physical factors or aesthetics, has imposed itself on people's bodies."" A quote at the book's opening that questions the very function and existential purpose of taking someone's photo too throws up some interesting questions about this project.

But really, there's just power in staring into someone's eyes and seeing what looks back. As Pieter puts it: ""There's something about if one is held in somebody else's gaze in the right way, there's something so beautiful about it; something so life-affirming.""

While many folks had the same vision of a carefree, cathartic stretch that could serve as a balm for the challenging last year, the warm months passed all too quickly and our new disturbing reality set in. Now, we’re in the post-daylight savings time abyss of 5 p.m. sunsets and disorientingly long stretches spent in our tiny apartments.

While autumn brings the looming uncertainty of yet another pandemic winter, it’s also given us perhaps the best run of new music we’ve had in ages. There have been blockbuster, paradigm-shifting pop records like Lil Nas X’s MONTERO, outstanding indie LPs like Illuminati Hotties’ Let Me Do One More and Lala Lala’s I Want the Door to Open, and incisive storytelling from artists like Xenia Rubinos and Maxo Kream. Here are all the best albums of fall 2021, so far.

Lil Nas X, MONTERO (September 17)

Looking at it cynically, the quality of Lil Nas X’s music kind of doesn’t even matter. He’s so charming and so good at being famous — specifically being famous online — that he’d still probably be going viral regularly if his songs were C-grade. But they’re not, and MONTERO is one of the most fun big-budget pop records we’ve gotten in ages.

You can’t praise the quality of MONTERO without mentioning Take a Daytrip, the production duo so closely associated with Nas X that when he pretended his debut album was a baby, they were the doctors who delivered it. Their marching band brigade on “INDUSTRY BABY” is resplendent, the menacing beat on “DOLLA SIGN SLIME” would be a standout on almost any good trap album, and the flamenco gallup of the title track will keep it a summer staple for years to come.

But these aren’t just great songs performed by a replacement level vocalist. Lil Nas X sells the yearning that makes “THAT’S WHAT I WANT” more than just a post-“Hey Ya” glossy radio single. His rich baritone shows vulnerability on the tender “SUN GOES DOWN,” and he raps with supreme authority on tracks like “INDUSTRY BABY,” even if he’s not a technical ace.

Nas’ first attempt at a longer body of work, 2019’s 7 EP, was mediocre apart from “Old Town Road” and had folks wondering if he was a one-trick pony. MONTERO proves that he’s developed a whole stable of skills.

Illuminati Hotties, Let Me Do One More (October 1)

Illuminati Hotties’ Sarah Tudzin is one of the quiet masterminds of modern indie rock. A true multi-hyphenate talent, she not only writes, sings and produces her own songs, but has worked on records by Pom Pom Squad, Porches and Weyes Blood.

Let Me Do One More is the outfit’s second LP — last year’s FREE I.H.: This Is Not the One You’ve Been Waiting For mixtape was released in part to help get Sarah out of a frustrating record label contract. That project was quite solid, but it’s clear why she was saving these songs, each one capable of lingering in your brain all day for different reasons.

There’s no shortage of quick-witted songwriters who can cook up a great hook today, but she stands apart for insightful takes on consumerism (“The corner store is selling spit / Bottled up for profit / I can't believe I'm buying in / Isn’t that genius?”), the characters of Los Angeles (“​​Joni is a black jean jacket / Joni's in the first band / Joni has a cool hand / Joni knows the problem is systematic”), and romance amid trying circumstances (“Never thought I’d grow attached / But now our sneakers match / And one of us always feels bad”).

And even though Let Me Do One More ends on a somber note — the pensive breakup ballad “Growth” — it’s proof that Illuminati Hotties is great whether on high heat or a low, gentle simmer.

Boylife, gelato (October 8)

On his debut album, Boylife uses gelato as a metaphor for the transience of life and love — as soon as you get your scoop it starts to melt. But it’s also a fitting comparison for the way this stellar LP sounds. It’s consistently rich, and there’s a bespoke, handcrafted quality to each song that allows some unconventional flavor pairings to complement each other beautifully (see the choral vocals and post-Yeezus industrial percussion of “church”).

Boylife (a.k.a. Los Angeles-based producer-vocalist Ryan Yoo) already has an auteur’s confidence. Ideas on gelato unfold slowly, like in a Kelly Reichardt movie. “Superpretty” starts off almost a trap song reflected in a funhouse mirror, before morphing into garage punk. Emotional ballad “baddreams” starts off with a simple piano arrangement before swelling strings bring it into Adele territory.

As a vocalist, Boylife is still finding a groove (he tries a lot of delivery styles and not all of them land), but as a song-builder he’s tremendous, and gelato is more than just a quick sugar high.

Lala Lala, I Want the Door to Open (October 8)

Lala Lala’s second album, 2018’s The Lamb, proved that Chicago-based singer and songwriter Lillie West could make great indie rock music. Her third, I Want the Door to Open, shows that she can make everything else just as well.

“Prove It” is one of the year’s great album cuts, as Lillie muses on someone’s unreachable romantic expectations atop an instrumental that starts off with one sparse guitar line and blooms into something at once dusky and bright. “And all the love in the world / Couldn’t fill all your need / Couldn’t build a city enough alive / For your thrill,” she laments. “Color of the Pool” features babbling streams of synths and hypnotic percussion, while the single “Diver” swells like the climactic music cue in a great coming-of-age film.

Lillie has spoken about water being an important metaphor on I Want the Door to Open, and the best moments of the record feel like stumbling onto a beach alone at sunrise. Possibility abounds, you’re totally present and you’re able to appreciate the little components that add up to a majestic whole — whether that’s hearing one of Lillie’s reedy vocal riffs or feeling cold sand beneath your feet.

Xenia Rubinos, Una Rosa (October 15)

It’s been five years since Xenia Rubinos released Black Terry Cat, her career-making sophomore LP that blended the music of her Puerto Rican and Cuban heritage with hip-hop, R&B and the jazz she studied in college. Her latest, Una Rosa, is a towering accomplishment — rich with characters and visual imagery, and brimming with urgent purpose.

Xenia has always been a brave songwriter, unafraid of taking the powerful and corrupt to task. On “Who Shot Ya?” she laments the killing of Breonna Taylor and the lack of consequences the officers who shot her faced. With “Working All the Time,” she tackles systemic class division (“You better keep me poor and busy / Or I’d be a danger / The truth is I’m a threat / And it’s got you upset”).

Sonically, the album is bountiful in experimentation, as she creates a new sonic context for “Una Rosa”, a song that used to play from a lamp in her abuelita’s room. She intertwines her vocals with icy synth lines on songs like “Did My Best” and “Si Llego” to create bold textures.

Maxo Kream, The Weight of the World (October 18)

Houston hip-hop is all about heritage, and Maxo Kream feels like the most direct link to the emotive storytelling of Scarface, Bun B and Z-Ro. Maxo went from best kept secret to a national name with 2019’s major label debut Brandon Banks, but Weight of the World is a stronger record, featuring his signature finely-etched storytelling.

Opener “CRIPSTIAN” feels like a sequel to “Meet Again,” one of the most gripping songs in his discography, in which he raps about the hardships of his loved ones and himself in vivid detail. “Codeine on my fuckin' bladder / Doctor say I'm gettin' fatter / Wealthy and not healthy, if you ask me, it don't fuckin' matter,” he laments. On “MAMA’S PURSE,” he recalls his mother shoplifting Rocawear and FUBU to keep her children happy. It’s a moving song about how our understanding of our parents can change so greatly when we reach adulthood ourselves.

Despite, or perhaps because of, his unmistakably Southern mannerisms (at one point he says “country like LeAnn Rimes”) Maxo has won fans all around the US. Just look at the features here — Tyler, the Creator on the swaggering single “BIG PERSONA,” A$AP Rocky coming to trade braggadocious bars on “STREETS ALONE” and Freddie Gibbs on the simmering, soulful “WHAT I LOOK LIKE.” Maxo does more than just hold his own, he brings them all into his world in unique ways.

Moon Kissed, I’d Like to Tell You Something Important (October 22)

Synth-pop whirlwind Moon Kissed have been making a name for themselves around New York thanks to jubilant, high-energy live shows where the trio’s chemistry is infectious. Their second album, I’d Like to Tell You Something Important, feels like the self-contained soundtrack to a great coming-of-age film, with soaring musical highs matched with lyrical honesty.

The powerful interlude “I’ll Ask for It” includes an important message about clear consent, and “Shake // Those Feelings” sees lead singer Khaya Cohen reflecting on heartbreak with major candor. The piano-powered closer “Chameleon” features the melancholic sting of a great Adele or Billie Eilish power ballad.

But I’d Like to Tell You Something is also an absolute blast, from the femme fatale-inspired, stomp-clap opener “Bubblegum” to the shapeshifting “Shake // Those Feelings,” which starts off Strokesian before a soaring electropop bridge later gives way to a stripped-down outro. With this album, Moon Kissed has found a way to do something even seasoned bands struggle with — bottling the alchemy of their concerts into something that you can listen to again and again.

Okay Kaya, The Incompatible Okay Kaya (October 22)

Not unlike great novelists Alexandra Kleeman or Ottessa Moshfegh, Okay Kaya is one of the great post-postmodern writers of our time. Her songs are recognizable in form, but distinctly 21st century in the way they tackle sex, friendship and mental health.

Her new mixtape, The Incompatible Okay Kaya, features stripped-back, acoustic version of previous standout songs like last year’s fuzzy slacker track “Psych Ward” and 2018’s minimalist R&B slow-burn “Dance Like U”. These versions highlight Kaya’s wry, evocative lyrics (“You can peel an orange however you please / In the psych ward”) and the elegance of her voice. “Ethereal” is perhaps the most overused adjective in music writing, but it’s genuinely apt for Okay Kaya.

Peppered throughout the mixtape are a few choice covers of songs like Nick Cave’s “Into My Arms” and Magnetic Fields’ “The Book of Love,” which despite the project’s title implying a lack of flexibility, are rendered beautifully.

The War on Drugs, I Don’t Live Here Anymore (October 29)

Sometime in the last decade, The War on Drugs quietly became one of the most dependable American bands. Inspired by the heartland rock sound of Bruce Springsteen and the keen eye of Bob Dylan, the Adam Granduciel-fronted operation put out two of the last decade’s best indie records, and picked up where they left off with I Don’t Live Here Anymore.

“Change” is vintage War on Drugs, to the point that it’s hard to believe Adam originally conceived of it as a piano ballad back in 2017. “Victim” leans more new wave than much of their previous work and the fact that its many crunchy textures never overwhelm the ear is a testament to I Don’t Live Here Anymore’s pristine production.

Pitchfork highlighted the way the band capture the feeling of liminal space in their music, and while the songs on I Don’t Live Here Anymore have a steady, warm hum to them, they’re always quietly shapeshifting. Just like change in real life, the best moments on their fifth album sneak up on you and overwhelm.

Dijon, Absolutely (November 5)

When an indie darling spends years building up to the release of their debut album, they face ever-escalating expectations from fans who’ve been in it from the jump. Since gaining notoriety as part of the duo Abhi//Dijon, Dijon Duenas has released a string of stellar singles and EPs, culminating in this year’s Absolutely, a remarkable body of work.

Dijon is a uniquely emotive vocalist. There’s a certain way his voice rasps on the hook of “Shouldn’t Have To” and “Talk Down” that feels so immediate as to recall “Drunk”, a bleary-eyed, baleful late night missive that’s among the best records he’s dropped.

The single “Many Times” is easily one of the year’s best songs. It’s one part Jai Paul, one part Bon Iver and two parts Vampire Weekend, but the delivery is vintage Dijon, conversational yet rife with feeling. He’s at his wits’ end on the song’s prehook, dropping a colorful string of connected rhymes in order to express romantic exasperation. “Strawberry, raspberry, candlelight, satellite, television, x-ray vision / What's it gonna take for you to listen?” he pleads.

Absolutely is stuffed to the gills with ideas, but Dijon executes pretty much all of them exceptionally well, from the 80s lite pop of “The Dress” to the vintage rap breakbeat of “Talk Down” to the extemporaneous rawness of “End of Record”. Dijon took his sweet time, but wound up making one of the best debut LPs of 2021.

Snail Mail, Valentine (November 5)

If there’s one silver lining of the pandemic, it’s the way that people swept up in momentum beyond their control could finally find balance once more. That’s what happened to Snail Mail’s Lindsey Jordan, who became alt rock royalty before turning 20, and was understandably overwhelmed by her newfound visibility.

Valentine, written in part during a stint back at her parents’ home during the early days of Covid, sees Lindsey get her footing back and then some. Lyrically, the songs are vintage Snail Mail in their candor and wit (“Moved on, but nothing feels true / Sometimes I hate her just for not being you,” she says on “Ben Franklin”), but the musical context is significantly bolder.

“Forever (Sailing)” has a dreamy, cinematic sway to it, while the title track feels like the final, bristling minute of Lush’s “Heat Wave” stretched out to the length of a full song. Working with Bon Iver and War on Drugs collaborator Brad Cook as her co-producer, Lindsey has done the equivalent of an independent filmmaker jumping into the studio system and making something just as good and pure as their early output.

As the title indicates, the album is about love, but in a way that’s both lofty and tactile, poetic and grounded. On “Madonna”, she blends soaring religious imagery with relatable stories of 21st century technology-aided squabbles. “Body and blood, I'll atone / Get to it now, or we can fight on the phone / I used to wanna get even, I'll just get stoned.”

Tasha, Tell Me What You Miss the Most (November 5)

One of the most beloved local figures of Chicago’s recent talent boom, Tasha is a heady singer-songwriter whose tracks contain flecks of folk, jazz and mellow indie rock. Tell Me What You Miss the Most, her second studio album, is lowkey but also charged with a kind of electricity that recalls the best work of Moses Sumney or Lomelda.

“Bed Song 1” is a perfect scene-setter — it’s ruminative and vulnerable, but never so ethereal as to feel weightless. Tasha once considered naming her debut album Bedtime, and she finds plenty to mine in the intimacy and vulnerability inherent to a room of one’s own. The lower guitar strings take on a rhythmic, percussive quality and Tasha uses the soundscape to muse about the push-pull of an artist’s life. “If I could I would stay / Here in this bed all day long / But I quite like the way / Pretty girls sway to my songs,” she says.

Heavy on glistening guitars and spectral vocals, Tell Me is ideal listening for the delicate stretch in between fall and winter, but more than that it’s an album that affirms and looks to the future without ignoring the pain of the past. On the standout “Year From Now”, she sings about reclaiming your sense of self. “Don't wait for a sign, it's time to let go / Stop wishing for someone to tell you some secret that you've always known,” she says. “Look for a sign of life in every breath and every sky and every hand hold.”

He has a bunch of Triforce pieces, and eventually, I’m told, he’ll defeat Ganon on his own. How fast it’ll take him to get there, I don’t know—I’ve never, gasp, finished the original! I’ll check back in when I’ve turned this piece into my editor. All of this is happening on Nintendo’s new Zelda-themed Game & Watch, a very cute $50 handheld released today celebrating the franchise's three decades of history, and a follow-up to last year’s similar pitch for Mario.

This object, like so many things in the past 18 months or so, was created during COVID-19. In normal times, I would have seen this at an event like E3, with a representative from Nintendo letting me poke at it, while they guided me through all the tiny details. Instead, Nintendo’s Ethan Stockton, who works on the product marketing team in the company’s Treehouse division, held one of the devices up to his webcam earlier this week, waiting for the auto focus to kick in long enough for me to read the text on the admittedly tiny handheld.

Crucially, the alluring it-plays-itself aspect of both devices is actually more useful on this new one, because it comes with a kickstand, albeit a cardboard one rather than a built-in, and the option to keep the power running until its battery dies. (Mario’s lasted about eight hours ). I, like many others, fruitlessly tried to prop the last Game & Watch up with a USB-C cable tucked around, hoping for Mario to loop endlessly as a table object for people to gawk at, only to watch it become dusty on a shelf. At least it’s a more viable option this time around, even if you’ll still have to snake in a cable.

The device contains three games: The Legend of Zelda (1986), The Adventure of Link (1987), and Link’s Awakening (1993). That’s more than last year’s Mario package, which included the original platformer and its pseudo-sequel Lost Levels, and Zelda games, being action RPGs, are longer experiences by design. It’s a lot of game, though inarguably not the most comfortable place to game, given some version of every game is available on Switch.

“I've been happy that we're still making cool physical objects like this, even with some of the challenges that we have had,” said Stockton, perhaps a nod to the ongoing global supply chain issues that’ve made creating anything, but especially gaming hardware , a challenge.

Miyamoto is the name most commonly associated with games like Zelda, but the original game was co-directed by Takashi Tezuka, who would also go on to direct games like Link to the Past, Super Mario Bros. 3, and numerous others. Tezuka is a creative powerhouse, and is also the producer who oversaw teams creating both of the recent Game & Watch devices, teams that were likely filled with younger employees who grew up playing Tezuka’s creation.

What’s included on the Game & Watch is plastic repacking of history, but it was overseen by history itself. Nintendo is unique in a number of ways, not least of which is how it’s managed to hold onto so many of its foundational creatives, who helped lay Nintendo’s gaming foundations and sensibilities in the 80s. Many, like Animal Crossing co-director Katsuya Eguchi or Mario designer Shigeru Miyamoto, have moved into largely executive roles. They still hold creative sway in the company, but they’re not really in the trenches, so to speak.

“He's [Tezuka] still there and very much still active and giving opinions in an oversight capacity on these projects,” said Stockton, who directly interacted with the team who built the Zelda Game & Watch. “It’s important to him to be someone who is continuing to raise up younger employees and pass on the traditions and ways of game creation and creating ways to play that have been part of Nintendo's DNA for a long time. It's fair to say that one of the reasons he's still directly involved is to be a steward for that creative process.”

“It started in my friend Mike's bedroom,” he said. “He had a Nintendo before I did. I remember watching him on one of the screens that had tons of trees and using the candle to burn a tree and a stairway appeared and he went in there. How did you know how to do that? Little did I know he had the strategy guide, like a lot of us did. But it looked like he was doing magic.”

One of the keys to Zelda, especially the early games, is a sense of mystery. While later games—cough, Skyward Sword, cough—would trip over themselves holding the player’s hand, those early experimental days were far different. You were just dropped into a world, and that sense of isolation and adventure helped make Breath of the Wild such a success.

Side note: It’s genuinely charming that a Nintendo employee also calls an NES a “Nintendo.”

Some of that magic and mystery is present in the Game & Watch itself, such as the way a hidden Triforce lights up on the back of the handheld when it’s turned on, or the ability to interrupt Link automatically playing through the original game and play a few moments yourself, at which point Link goes back to doing his thing. It’s a throwback to attract modes, where games played themselves, a slice of gaming history that I wish would come back.

One thing that’s not an easter egg but that I had to try for myself was interrupting Link’s automated playthrough and trying to get him killed. Link didn’t seem happy about it, and had enough hearts to take quite the wallop from a screen filled with enemies, but there is no game over screen. The moment Link “dies” he reappears in the same place he was before. Must be nice, buddy. And, no, before you ask the same question I did, you cannot just hold Link into place and prevent him from finishing his quest. Eventually, Link will use some Nintendo Magic (™) to catch up and defeat Ganon at the pace he’s been programmed to."

The bartender was saying that he had worked there on and off during college, then came back for good “when Covid ended.” He clarified immediately: “So, about a year ago.” Hearing that was surreal—Covid had not ended at all where I now live (in D.C.), and certainly not an entire year ago.

By “Covid,” of course, neither he nor I actually meant the particular coronavirus that made its way around the world in 2020 after (likely) leaking from a research lab in Wuhan. We meant everything it had caused—or, perhaps more accurately, every injustice big and small for which it gave the ruling class a pretext. School closures, economic shutdowns, mask theater, vaccine fanaticism—these, more than the flu-like symptoms that can do real damage to vulnerable patients, define Covid for the vast majority of us.

Apparently, all of that came to a close a while ago back home. I’m not sure I saw a single mask the entire week I was there. Even in the winter off-season, the waterfront district where we were eating was pretty heavily trafficked. My 76-year-old grandfather came over for Thanksgiving dinner the next day, and lived to tell the tale. Besides that one offhanded mention by the bartender, I don’t think Covid came up once in conversation during the entire visit.

I returned to Washington Sunday afternoon, a full six days after Mayor Bowser had finally lifted her second citywide mask mandate. Nevertheless, as soon as I crossed into the District, I started to notice people walking alone, outside, on empty sidewalks, masked. What exactly they thought they were protecting themselves from was entirely unclear. Why they felt they had to was even more inscrutable. Yet here they were, in the open air, draped in the sacramental vestments of the medical religion.

It is hard to think at this point that Covid will ever end for these people. The behaviors and attitudes that help perpetuate the pandemic regime have been conditioned in them in a way that will be very hard to shake. The wild-eyed cat ladies who post gleefully on Facebook and Twitter about continued double-masking after their third shot of Moderna are not going to stop just because Muriel Bowser has finally told them they can. They don’t want to.

They live in a world of their own. It was made and is ruled by a merciless god called Science, whose high priest and self-professed voice on earth is Dr. Anthony Fauci. Its highest goods are all material or shallow: mere life, stimulus checks. The deeper things to which these should be linked, the fruits of true religion most of all, but also the basics of physical health and fitness and real community, are either unknown or reviled. The moral landscape of their world is utterly barren.

We cannot possibly expect them to think about things the same way we do, to act the way we might act. They are not like us; they have been formed by an altogether different reality. So what to do?

It is trendy on the right these days to talk about America as two countries coexisting within one border. In its more-or-less current iteration, the talking point goes back at least to David Brooks’ famous division of Red America and Blue America, but now—in a moment many say is as divisive as any since the 1860s—the conversation has lurched towards talk of some kind of National Divorce. The ever widening gap between coastal elites and heartland folk will simply have to be formalized, these people claim, with Red America and Blue America giving up on each other at last.

But it could not possibly be so simple. There is nothing as easy or as final as civil war in our future.

There is no Red America, and there is no Blue America. My hometown, where the Covid cult lost control last time around the sun, is in deep-blue Massachusetts. The Swamp where I’m stranded now is locked between two states (Maryland and Virginia) with elected Republican governors. The actual divide is something much closer to Michael Lind’s paradigm of hub cities and heartlands—the progressive metropolis on the one hand, and pretty much everything else on the other.

There is no way to divorce the hub cities from the rest of the country. Yes, right now, it feels like we can. I spent the last week in small towns in Massachusetts and Pennsylvania that felt absolutely normal. And they should. But the strategy of retreating to these places while the Muriel Bowsers and Bill De Blasios of the world wreck the hubs from which we’ve fled can only end in failure. We are too connected.

It is not enough to extract ourselves from the places where the new religion rules; it is precisely in these places that the fight against it is most important. As long as Covid—not the virus but the ideology—keeps its reservoirs in the cities, the heartlands will never really be safe from it.

They’ve practically told us as much. Two days after my run-in with reality in a Massachusetts bar, the world received news of a scary new variant in South Africa: Omicron. It hasn’t reached the U.S. yet, but when it does, the hub city oligarchs stand ready to act against it. Per the New York Times, they’ve learned from their mistakes: “After nearly two years of facing accusations that they were too slow and timid in tackling the pandemic, many policymakers would rather risk overreacting to a new threat than underreacting.”

In the fantasy world where Tony Fauci is pontifex maximus, the problem with Covid round one was that the government didn’t do nearly enough. People who subscribe to that lunatic creed will never be content to leave you in peace while you infect your neighbors. You should not be content to leave them in peace while they infect their own."

Last week, another piece of the vaccine mythology … [+6564 chars]",Right,"The Covid vaccine increases early pregnancy loss, yet thousands of women must take it, as we continue to reap the fruits of trying to invert nature.

Last week, another piece of the vaccine mythology unraveled.

In a new examination of the CDC’s study on the effects of the Covid-19 vaccine on pregnant women, two doctors from New Zealand found the shot caused 82 to 91 percent of women in their first trimester to experience a “spontaneous abortion,” or miscarriage. This figure is seven to eight times higher than the average rate of pregnancy loss for women in the first 20 weeks of pregnancy.

The original CDC study claims only 12.6 percent of the vaccinated pregnant women had a spontaneous abortion during the course of the study, on par with typical early pregnancy loss. However, the majority of women studied—between 700 to 713 of 827—were exposed to the vaccine after the first 20 weeks of pregnancy, the most vulnerable stage. Of those who were early in their pregnancy, the miscarriage rate was far higher. Doctors Aleisha Brock and Simon Thornley concluded not only that the original CDC study is misleading, but that the vaccine should not be recommended for pregnant or breastfeeding women, as well as children and anyone in the general population of childbearing age, due to this high incidence of miscarriage.

The vaccine vector is just the latest episode in the greater series of female fertility problems. While women in their 20s are getting paid to get their eggs harvested (resulting in ovarian cysts, endometriosis, and infertility, among other ailments, for a staggering number of the women who undergo this procedure), those on the waning end of fertility compose a lucrative market for those eggs, encouraging the cycle to continue.

And still, at least 10 percent of women in the United States between the ages of 15 and 44 wish to have a child but cannot; the percentage is surely higher when we examine only the women who are over the age of 35. For this demographic, the question is no longer how not to have children but, incredibly, how to have them. Infertility galls them—not because every woman secretly wants to birth a quiver full, but because most women, in most cases, assume that at some point down the road they’ll probably have a family. As always, women want options, even if they refuse all of them. Says one woman, after her egg harvesting procedure left her infertile, “on one hand, I never intended to have children, but I didn’t want biology to force that on me.”

It’s not just that we’ve failed to teach young women about fertility, as many have pointed out, but that we are trying to do things backwards, out of accord with nature: fun now (while you’re fertile), babies later (when you’re not). We should know how that will go. Only 11.5 percent of American women will become pregnant before they are 30, a record low. After 30, at record highs, the childbearing rate for women is still a sparse 7.3 percent. In part due to choice, and in part because decades of social and economic pressures have come to bear on the American woman, the downward trajectory of birth rates seems, to activists, either irrelevant or precisely the point.

In the “choice” category, we have women like Emily Holleman, who wrote recently for The Cut about her radical decision to have a child in these “apocalyptic times,” and how she almost repented of doing so. The hackneyed line, “I couldn’t imagine bringing a child into the world as it is today,” with its historical blindness that believes ours is unquestionably the Worst of All Eras, is the mantra of this crowd. Climate change, Covid-19, racism, Donald Trump, you name it—these women use any and every reason to claim ham-fisting autonomy from nature is really an act of selfless love toward the next generation that will never be; to gift, as it were, human extinction. This crowd is small, typically confined to magazine writers and 30-somethings with little talent for self-reflection (saith another young magazine writer, with perhaps a little reflective talent).

But in the other category are normal women: They want children—probably sooner, though they’ll always profess “later”—yet remain captive to strong social forces and, increasingly, biological ones outside their control. These are the ones for whom the inheritance of birth control and job expectations were taken for granted; they grew up believing an unwanted pregnancy would be far more of a common problem, and didn’t worry about it until they came of age not “thirty, flirty, and thriving,” but single, lonely, and on anti-depressants.

The anti-natal forces on such women are both biological and societal. Aside from the modern diet, whose effect on both male and female fertility is about as difficult to prove and easy to intuit as the water contamination in Woburn, Massachusetts, the hurdles to having healthy children in America today are numerous. While a career certainly demands a woman postpone her family, a whole generation of men in retreat and an epidemic of loneliness certainly compound the picture, while anything from acne medication to anti-depressants are probably suppressing either her or her husband’s ability to produce viable offspring.

Few will be fortunate and conceive a miracle baby; will we then sabotage even these, and choose political correctness at the expense of human life?

In all this, the progressive woman’s attitude toward pregnancy is disgust. Both incredibly optimistic about the female body’s ability to conceive and incredibly pessimistic about their own methods of preventing pregnancy, they are all horrified at the prospect of a child. When the latest Texas abortion law was passed, one doctor took to Twitter immediately, telling women to “Get on birth control. Now.”

Get on Birth Control Now. Any form that is reliable. Oral Contraceptives, Nuva Ring, Norplant, IUD. Something. Now. — Dara Kass, MD (@darakass) September 1, 2021

We don’t just ignore the fertility problem, we—certainly, Holleman and Kass do—encourage it. Having a baby is selfish, because of the ozone layer, or some such. Or worse, it’s the actual stuff of nightmares. Advising women to take pregnancy tests as frequently as they menstruate, Dara Kass concluded her thread by saying, “This is a horrific time, We are all scared, And we are sorry we let this happen.” Elsewhere on Twitter, women dreamt of the day they could get a hysterectomy so they could get off the pill. Nothing is worse for these women than the idea of children.

In light of that attitude, it’s no wonder the vaccine’s affect on pregnancy doesn’t bother them. But the mandates reach more than just these. The real battle being fought is by the women who do want to have children, and it’s uphill every step of the way."

At least for now.

While Europe lurches toward authoritarianism lite in the name of Covid-era love—“protecting your loved ones”—it is the U.K. that is finally standing up for civil liberties and acting more like the country that gave the world Magna Carta. For now, the U.K. holds strong, a beacon in the darkness while Europe capitulates. Remind you of any particular time?

Us Brits admittedly have a somewhat tedious habit—usually expressed during big international sporting events—of harping back to World War II and clutching at our finest moment. But it’s hard not to see World War II parallels given the way Europe is reacting to Covid-19, with yet another country embracing vaccine mandates or some sort of illiberal national policy. And these are not just any countries: The most enthusiastic are those who formed the Axis alliance during the war.

“It is entirely appropriate to reel in shock that the government of a modern and prosperous central European country should enforce by sanction of criminal law the injection of a powerful drug into the bodies of all its citizens,” Patrick O’Flynn says about the Austrian government’s announcement that it will make Covid-19 vaccinations mandatory by law in February next year.

In his article “The Austrian Solution” for London-based the Critic magazine, one of the few U.K. media companies to continually speak out against Covid-19 restrictions, O’Flynn confronts the obvious fact that “as the birthplace of Adolf Hitler and an enthusiastic embracer of Nazism back in the day, Austria has historic form for this sort of thing.”

All the while, Austria’s neighbor Germany continues emitting noises suggesting it will follow suit. At a recent press conference, German Health Minister Jens Spahn, through a deft sleight of hand, coopted the cynicism of others to send exactly the same chilling message but with governmental authority: “Probably by the end of this winter pretty much everyone in Germany—as has sometimes been cynically put—will be vaccinated, cured or dead,” Spahn said. Inspiring stuff.

Italy has brought in the Green Pass, a digital or paper certificate showing that the holder has been vaccinated, tested negative, or recovered from Covid-19. It is required by all employees as well as for cultural and sporting events, long-distance travel, nightlife, and indoor dining in restaurants. Enjoy your pasta outside this December.

One doesn’t want to be disrespectful to these countries, yet when it comes to obvious disturbing historical echoes, it seems the blinkers are firmly on, at least for the governments; there have been significant protests by the citizenry at these drastic restrictions, especially in Italy and Austria.

“Because governments around the world have assumed responsibility for control of viruses in the last year and a half, by doing that they’ve put themselves into a bind,” said Freddie Sayers, executive editor of UnHerd, another U.K.-based publication that has regularly pushed back against the U.K. government’s handling of lockdowns and restrictions, in an interview. Sayers recently reported on the ground in Austria about the government’s initial announcement—preceding the mandatory vaccination decision—of a new lockdown for the unvaccinated.

“When things are not going well, they need to take action, and that’s what we saw in Austria. The cases are going up—it’s constant up and down between countries, with Austria currently having a bad time of it in terms of case numbers—so of course the government felt compelled to do something.”

It’s the civilian equivalent of succumbing to the classic mission creep that has attended so many military misadventures, most recently and obviously in Iraq and Afghanistan.

“Across Europe, basic norms of civilized society are giving way to panic,” Jonathan Sumption, a former justice of the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom wrote in a recent comment piece for the Daily Telegraph, on the of U.K.’s most prominent newspapers. “We are witnessing the ultimate folly of frightened politicians who cannot accept that they are impotent in the face of some natural phenomena.”

For now, the British government is resisting the irresistible pull of mission creep that so often leads to far worse calamity. I was shocked by much of the U.K. government’s draconian response to Covid-19 in 2020. But after loosening up a bit, for now it is standing up to those in the U.K. clamoring for more restraints in step with what is happening in Europe: in response to the Omicron variant, the government has responded with limited restrictions, including masks in some settings and self-isolation for those returning from foreign travel until a negative test result, with a review set for after three weeks. Again, there are odd echoes of WWII and its early, crucial stage, when the U.K. was torn between going it alone against the (at that point) all-conquering Nazis or suing for some sort of peace.

British Prime Minister Boris Johnson is known to be a fan of Winton Churchill and isn’t shy of embracing potential opportunities for comparisons that might be made. The general consensus—backed by ample evidence—is that he is nowhere near being Churchillian, but the fact remains, as O’Flynn noted, that Johnson has shown a degree of political courage in fending off the lockdownistas and mask zealots clamoring for more.

“By the time Covid finally exits its long epidemic phase and we learn to live—and sometimes die—with it, Britain may be seen to have been the doughty defender of freedom and Austria the birthplace of something much more sinister,” O’Flynn said.

But perhaps the U.K. will fold to its own worst impulses, too. As in the U.S., there are plenty in the U.K. (and, as in the U.S., often on the “liberal” left) who seem determined to turn society into some sort of autocrat’s fantasy land, with the population forever inhibited, malleable, and pliant.

One of the constants throughout the pandemic, in almost every country, has been how—usually in the name of loving protection—so many actions encouraged by the secular state have inverted basic tenants of Christianity. In addition to the misery these measures have caused, in Europe this means going against the closest thing it has in terms of a founding document like the U.S. Constitution. In his famous 2006 “Regensburg Address,” Pope Benedict XVI discussed how “Christianity, despite its origins and some significant developments in the East, finally took on its historically decisive character in Europe” and that “this convergence, with the subsequent addition of the Roman heritage, created Europe and remains the foundation of what can rightly be called Europe.”

Europe is becoming increasingly unmoored from its Christian foundation—and the subsequent vacuum is being filled by an elite that seems determined to tell its inconvenient populous what to do and not to do. While the U.K. has followed a similar secular trend to the U.S., if not more so, it fortunately has the English Common law and the principle, defended so vigorously by the late Roger Scruton, whereby you are free until the law forbids you, as opposed to the Continental presumption that you are free only if the law explicitly allows you. “And it happens that they only say, ‘Do this and do that,’ but there is nothing to do because they do not do anything good, all they do is talk,” Leo Tolstoy’s Jesus says in his Gospel in Brief.

Whatever one thinks of Covid-19, its immense disruptive effects on societies and the world have offered a fantastic opportunity for those seeking to make a play for more power, influence, and, of course, money. Mandates are fundamentally about controlling people.

The suppression and control of both liberty and religion was all too familiar to Viktor Frankl, the Austrian psychiatrist, philosopher, author, and Holocaust survivor. He was also well attuned to the dangers of the sorts of dehumanising fatalistic tendencies that have characterized the responses to Covid-19 by governments everywhere—in Europe, in the U.K., and in the U.S.

“A psychotherapist is continually concerned with spiritual existence in terms of freedom and responsibility, and with marshalling it against the psychophysical facticity which the patient is prone to accept as his fate,” Frankl wrote in The Unconscious God. “The awareness of freedom and responsibleness which constitutes authentic humanness must be set against this neurotic fatalism.”

Europe appears in the grip of neuroses. How long can the U.K. hold out? Will the U.S. need to offer its aid again? Haven’t we been here before? Why do we never learn?

“The way is wide open to despotism and unending social discord,” Sumption said. “The rest of us should look on and note how easily liberal democracy can be subverted by fear.”

After being told their requests for religious exemption to the vaccine mandate would likely be denied, members of the military are now facing removal, and possibly recoupment of their training costs, if they refuse the Covid-19 mRNA shot.

On October 21, the Marine Corps published new instructions regarding the Covid-19 vaccine mandate in the military. The paper confirmed that Marines who refuse the vaccine, absent an approved exemption, will be “processed for administrative separation”—in other words, they will be kicked out. Moreover, Marines who are separated for vaccination refusal “will not be eligible for involuntary separation pay and will be subject to recoupment of any unearned special or incentive pays and advance educational assistance.” Marines who are receiving Transfer of Education Benefits who fail to complete their service obligation by leaving the Corps will also lose their post-9/11 G.I. bill benefits and “may be subject to recoupment if the Veterans Affairs has already processed a payment for transferred benefits.”

What all of this means—how much “recoupment” includes, from the cost of a specific kind of training to the price tag on all the military’s prior investment in a given service member—is still up for speculation. But the notice, the third in a chain of increasingly hawkish notices from the Corps’ higher command on implementing the vaccine, certainly reads threateningly. In the wake of a 10 year pilot shortage, and with low numbers of troops on the whole, the military’s move is bold—and potentially counterproductive.

Since the Biden administration announced the mandate, military lawyers in D.C. say they have received hundreds of calls from service members who don’t want to take the vaccine. And yet, despite a flurry of religious exemption requests from the 3 percent of active duty troops who remain unvaccinated, the Department of Defense says it is not currently taking any action on the question. Though the Navy has approved a total of five medical exemptions for the vaccine, neither it nor the Marine Corps have approved a single religious exemption so far.

Last week, anonymous DoD officials told the New York Times that “no one is actively discouraging people in the military from seeking a religious exemption. But anyone seeking one from the Pentagon or Department of Veterans Affairs would be required to have an established history of adherence to a religion that prohibits vaccines, among other things.”

Prior to Covid-19, the greatest pushback on a vaccine mandate in the military was with the anthrax vaccine, produced by Michigan Biologic Products Institute. Between 1998 to 2004, when the anthrax vaccine was mandated for troops, at least 500 service members refused the vaccine; all were disciplined or kicked out of the military. Yet in 2005, an investigative report by a Virginia newspaper revealed that, despite years of testimony, the Pentagon never told Congress that as many as 20,000 troops were hospitalized after taking the shot. Cited by the FDA in 1997 and subject to several investigations, reviews, and criticism for its handling of the vaccine, the anthrax vaccine producer has since become Emergent BioSolutions, the same company subcontracted to provide the Johnson & Johnson COVID-19 vaccine.

While some troops today are submitting religious exemption requests, others say the mandate itself is illegal, because it contradicts prior Department of Defense regulations. One group of 16 soldiers is currently suing the Department of Defense claiming that because the soldiers have natural immunity, or are pregnant or trying to conceive, and thus vulnerable to potential side effects from the new treatment, they should not be required to take the shot. This is the second lawsuit launched by military personnel in response to the mandate, after two staff sergeants filed a suit on August 17 in the U.S. District Court for the District of Colorado, seeking an exception to the order for military members who have recovered from Covid-19.

The staff sergeants in the Colorado case are appealing to Army Regulation 40-562, which exempts troops from vaccination when they are documented survivors of the illness, since they have acquired immunity. Per the army regulation the troops cite, qualifying medical exemptions should include any “underlying health condition of the vaccine candidate (for example, based on immune competence, pharmacologic or radiation therapy, pregnancy and/or previous adverse response to immunization)” or “evidence of immunity based on serologic tests, documented infection, or similar circumstances.”

A handful of patients have reported cases of myocarditis or thrombosis, inflammation of the heart muscle and abnormal blood clot formation that causes a stroke, respectively, after taking the vaccine. These cases are statistically few, and while several have resulted in deaths, many mild cases have resolved; yet, they seem to occur far more frequently in younger patients. For young pilots, who cannot fly if they do develop such a heart condition, no matter how mild, the risk is certainly more serious.

Indeed, pilots present a particular problem for the Department of Defense, in light of the pilot shortage it has been talking about for the last ten years. As of March 2019, according to an inventory report from the Marine Corps headquarters, overall fixed-wing, company grade aviation strength stood at a staggering 52 percent. In addition to a bottleneck in the process of getting soldiers into the cockpit, the military has also struggled to retain its pilots beyond a certain level in their career; getting ahead is too difficult, so they’re getting out instead. The DoD’s globalist instincts aside, they have put themselves in an interesting bind by calling soldiers to vaccinate or get the boot when, in reality, their desire for troops demands just the opposite.

Despite the Nation Defense Authorization Act’s original provision that soldiers discharged for refusing the shot would receive no less than an honorable discharge, the Navy has said that those who are kicked out for refusing the vaccine will receive, at the highest, a general discharge under honorable conditions. This can disqualify former service members from veteran benefits. Jeff Steele, legislative attache for the American Legion’s National Security Division, said this is because service members who join the military give up a lot of individual freedoms, by definition.

“You’re basically offering up your life, under the most extreme circumstances,” Steele told The American Conservative. “Military service comes with a lot of demands and a lot of obligations, and people that serve have to be willing to comply with those demands and obligations, otherwise the military doesn’t work. If you refuse a shot or vaccination or whatever, then that’s not a perfect service.”

Of the service branches, the Marine Corps currently has the lowest vaccination rate, at 85 percent, while the Navy has the highest, at 98 percent. In order to be considered fully vaccinated by Nov. 28, the deadline for active-duty sailors and Marines, troops who haven’t gotten a Pfizer or Moderna shot prior to Oct. 24 will have to receive the Johnson & Johnson vaccine by Nov. 14—or file a religious appeal—to avoid consequences. For reserve members, meanwhile, the deadline is not until June 2022. Currently, only about 40 percent of the Army Reserve and 38 percent of the National Guard are fully vaccinated.

While many Republicans in congress have spoken up about vaccine mandates in the private sector, few have carried over that enthusiasm to the military mandate, as the military is generally seen as subject to a more several rule, categorically. Still, some like Thomas Massie, a representative from Kentucky, argue that even a lawful mandate does not provide the Department of Defense carte blanche to trample soldiers’ first amendment right to the free exercise of religion, which Massie claims is being ignored by the military’s failure to approve religious accommodation requests.

Oklahoma Senator James Inhofe, the top Republican on the Senate Armed Services Committee, demanded in a letter last month that the Defense Department abandon the mandate for troops and civilian personnel altogether, citing the vaccine’s “haphazard implementation” and “political motivations,” following a group of 30 some Republicans who sought to take down the mandate prior to its conception in September. The former chairman of the armed services committee said he had “grave concerns” about the impact the mandate would have on both troop readiness and morale.

“Plainly stated, no service member, Department of Defense civilian or contractor supporting the department should be dismissed due to failure to comply with the mandate until the ramifications of mass dismissal are known,” Inhofe wrote."

This isn’t about the rights and wrongs of masks as an appropriate measure against Covid-19. You’ve read enough about that. This is about the implications of mask wearing for those with mental health issues such as post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and how the issue gets buried in the mask debate—or lack thereof.

In the U.K. I was technically exempt from having to wear a mask when it became mandatory in July 2020, due to my PTSD-related moral injury following military tours in Kosovo, Iraq, and Afghanistan. The page on the U.K. government website explaining exemptions stated in confusing terms that a “reasonable excuse” for not wearing a mask was “because of any physical or mental illness or impairment, or disability” or if it caused “severe distress.”

Guess what’s the easiest and fastest technique if a PTSD-symptom flares up—or if you experience any unpleasant emotion? Take a good long deep breath while focusing in particular on the exhalation to activate the parasympathetic nervous system to slow down the heart and help calm you down. It has been advocated since the teachings of the Buddha. It’s not so easy to do when wearing a mask.

Initially, I tried to toe the line on masks, conscious that my moral injury is relatively small-fry on the PTSD spectrum, for which I am grateful—many veterans, as well as civilians who have suffered childhood neglect, or sexual or domestic abuse, are dealing with far darker demons. But the equivocating claims and data about the effectiveness of wearing masks have withered away against the nauseating psychological effect of feeling gagged and being taken back to where I was after Afghanistan.

It hasn’t been such an issue for me since the U.K. lifted mask mandates and largely left it to personal choice. Not so in the U.S., as I discovered upon my recent return, especially in the north eastern area of New York, Washington, D.C., and Boston, where it is mask up and shut up.

This stance strikes me as ironic at various levels. The U.S. is meant to be the land of mental health considerations. The U.S. often gets lampooned for its seemingly obsessive therapy culture. But this also means it is a world leader in parsing the likes of trauma and PTSD, assisted by research spurred by the National Institute of Mental Health, the National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine, and private foundations that study the efficacy of alternative forms of trauma treatment such as yoga, theater, and psychedelic-assisted talk therapy. Despite all this, masks and mental health rarely gets mentioned as the sledgehammer approach to masks is taken, with everyone expected to mask up regardless.

Explaining the full complexities behind why I struggle to comply with the tannoy’s pronouncement to don a “protective face covering” would take too long here. But, in short: The intensity of my moral injury relates to not talking about events, especially those in Afghanistan, allowing them to fester for a decade until I finally sought counselling in 2020; but that breakthrough moment of literally opening my mouth for the first time to the counsellor, family, and others—which while enormously painful was also hugely necessary and healing—collided with society suddenly embracing covering and inhibiting the essential organ of speech and articulation (and breathing). A conflicting situation.

If that sounds a bit woolly, I’d refer you to TheBody Keeps the Score: Brain, Mind, and Body in the Healing of Trauma by Bessel Van der Kolk. “These feelings are almost impossible to articulate,” Van der Kolk says. “Trauma by nature drives us to the edge of comprehension, cutting us off from language based on common experience or an imaginable past.”

Oddly enough, often the fiercest mask legalists are the normally mental-health-focused left. These are people who likely read The Body Keeps the Score—it was a number one New York Times bestseller, after all—but they have forgotten its lessons.

Van der Kolk discusses the work of psychiatrist Abram Kardiner, who in 1941 had published his The Traumatic Neuroses of War about his dealings with World War I veterans. In addition to Kardiner identifying how sufferers of traumatic neuroses develop a chronic vigilance for and sensitivity to threat, Van der Kolk highlights how Kardiner was the first to demonstrate that “post-traumatic stress isn’t ‘all in one’s head’, as some people supposed, but has a physiological basis.”

Van der Kolk explains how “Kardiner understood even then that the symptoms have their origin in the entire body’s response to the original trauma.” Hence Kardiner might have had something to say about the very physical act of someone with PTSD enduring a face mask, and how that might intersect with his sensitivity to threat.

Of course, it is not just those with PTSD. In a café, I saw a masked server hand a customer his coffee. The forearm of her left arm was blanketed in lacerations of scar tissue. She sounded cheery enough in the moment—and perhaps she has moved on from darker days of self-harm—but at the same time she had little choice in needing to be perky on the job while wearing a mask, cut off from face to face human connection.

“Deep down many traumatized people are even more haunted by the shame they feel about what they themselves did or did not do under the circumstances,” Van der Kolk says. “We have learned that trauma is not just an event that took place sometime in the past; it is also the imprint left by that experience on mind, brain and body.”

Dealing with shame and guilt is not helped by slapping a mask on your face—a less than empowering posture that is likely to add to the trust and intimacy issues that trauma sufferers typically struggle with. It’s a finger in the eye of that traumatic imprint.

“We have also begun to understand how overwhelming experiences affect our innermost sensations and our relationship to our physical reality—the core of who we are,” says Van der Kolk, who highlights the importance of such basic activities as breathing, moving, and touching in regulating our own physiology and well-being.

“When we ignore these quintessential dimensions of humanity, we deprive people of ways to heal from trauma and restore their autonomy.”

This is about much more than veterans and masks. Trauma is an unavoidable part of the human condition, which modern society seems set on finding additional ways to accentuate. Through a life lived, eventually everyone carries trauma and must learn how to deal with it.

The psychological implications of mask wearing are only one of innumerable negative consequences of Covid-19 restrictions that typically are left undiscussed. Covid-19 is a serious threat to vulnerable individuals. But honestly weighing that threat against the fallout that restrictions like masks inflict on other vulnerable people still rarely happens.

Apparently, losing the 2018 Senate race to Ted Cruz and the 2020 Democratic presidential primary has not deterred him from a trying a third time.

While we can all have a good laugh at the thought of the Spanglish-speaking, skateboarding, gun-snatchingman-child running once more, this time for the highest office of the nation’s second-largest state, we should also take it seriously. There’s a good chance O’Rourke actually wins this time.

As I’ve argued before, Texas may seem like a conservative bulwark, but it is very much a battleground state that could easily turn blue under the right conditions. Senator Ted Cruz and President Trump, both well-funded and well-known candidates, won the state with relatively small margins. Texas’s major cities all reliably vote blue, and the margins in cities could get even worse for the GOP with the recent influx of new residents from blue states.

Moreover, no one should underestimate the complacency of conservatives who live in prosperous conservative states. Unlike Americans in other states who have to worry about things like employment, public safety, and being able to go out without a face mask, Texans can afford to take up progressive causes and naively vote for Democrats. Having never experienced the real effects of dysfunctional government, many younger, more formally educated Texans will push for less law enforcement, more homeless encampments, and endless progressive virtue signaling if they feel they have an attractive Democratic candidate.

Not so long ago, the red-blue flip happened in California. Once upon a time, it was a Republican state, attracting people with its great weather, limited government, and entrepreneurial culture. Then, convinced of their invincibility, voters in the state began electing Democrats. Within a few decades, it became effectively a one-party state.

O’Rourke clearly hopes to replicate this in Texas. Since the state’s economy is doing well and thus not a big priority for many voters, O’Rourke’s campaign will likely focus on cultural issues instead of economic ones: abortion, legalizing pot, and Covid-19 (which is mostly a cultural issue at this point).

O’Rourke knows he can exploit Texans’ insecurity with their conservative image. All too many Texans—I base this off of my own experience living and working in a Dallas suburb—want to be perceived as fashionable and worldly. They desperately want to shake off the popular image of Texans as provincial Bible-thumping cowboys who only know how to drill for oil—or worse, uncool propane salesmen living in ugly suburban developments. They would prefer the image of a sensitive, secular, educated progressive who smokes weed and drinks craft beer—in other words, like Beto.

Still, it’s notable that Beto brought up the power failures from the snowstorm this past February. It was one of those infamous examples of Republican leadership catering to business interests at the cost of common good. It also didn’t help the Republican cause that Beto’s old opponent, Sen. Ted Cruz, decided to go on vacation in Mexico to wait out the crisis. Ironically, it was Gov. Rick Perry’s decision to subsidize and support unreliable renewable-energy sources that played a large role in those power failures.

Since O’Rourke is a Democrat, and likely favors renewables, it’s unclear what he would have done differently as governor. More than likely, with a Governor O’Rourke, Texas would be in even worse shape—similar to California, where blackouts are common occurrences.

It’s likely that O’Rourke will also take advantage of a contentious Republican primary that may take out Governor Abbot and replace him with a lesser-known conservative firebrand. Abbott’s two main challengers, Allen West and Don Huffines, are both far to the right of him politically. Even if they fail to defeat Abbott, West and Huffines will likely force him to run away from moderate challengers, attack his record and image, and leave him foundering against an unchallenged O’Rourke who will have had all of his work done for him.

And while Abbott can brag about his large war chest, Democrats will happily throw money and support at their man (O’Rourke’s campaign raised $2 million in its first 24 hours) if they feel like there’s a possibility of victory. Rest assured, O’Rourke will once again appear on every media outlet and be hailed as the next Bobby Kennedy. So long as he doesn’t mock Abbott’s disability like Wendy Davis did eight years go, there will be a full media blitz to erase his many gaffes, his criminal record, and utter lack of political accomplishments.

All told, conservative voters have good reason to be concerned. If they aren’t careful, O’Rourke could become the next Jon Ossoff—another forgettable failure who somehow won the Senate seat in conservative Georgia.

However, if they are mindful of the threat posed by O’Rourke, Abbott can win this election and continue being a strong governor for the GOP. He has already overseen remarkable economic growth, opposed most of the absurd regulations for Covid-19, headed off the shenanigans of state Democrat legislators, and taken the right stances against illegal immigration, abortion, and attempts to dismantle law enforcement. Sure, he’s no Ron DeSantis—but he does a darn good impression. This Texan thinks that should earn Beto a third loss.

The worst bout of food poisoning I ever had took days to run its course, as every orifice did its duty to rid my body of whatever evil I had ingested. That brings us to the Clintons and Virginia.

The defeat of the Democratic party in Virginia in general and Terry McAuliffe for governor in the specific could finally be the end of the Clintons and a chance for the Democratic Party to rescue itself from the self-destructive path it is on. It could heal and become a righteous challenger to Republicans. Or it might just eat another chili dog and puke through the midterms.

Of all the things Terry McAuliffe is—mediocre former governor, race-monger, liar, visa fraudster, investment scammer—he is also the last bit of Clintonite pollution the body politic needed to expel to allow healing to begin.

McAuliffe was co-chairman of Bill’s 1996 campaign, Clinton-installed chair of the Democratic National Committee 2001-2005, and chair of Hillary Clinton’s failed 2008 presidential campaign. Bill and Hillary leveraged their then-popularity to help McAuliffe win the Virginia governorship as payback. In 2013, Bill did a nine-city tour of Virginia with McAuliffe, while Hillary raised money for him in California. As Virginia’s governor, McAuliffe was a campaign surrogate for Hillary 2016. McAuliffe had never held public office and wasn’t even from Virginia but the job was up for grabs in a state trending blue and the Clinton’s turned on the money spigot.

Bill Clinton, disgraced as he is, actually still held fundraisers for McAuliffe in 2021, albeit in New York, not Virginia, an early clue to how things would end. Terry nurtured the relationship at every opportunity and got ahead, a reminder of the transactional politics the Clintons thrived on. Compare his political run with fellow Clinton sycophant Andrew Cuomo. After the departure of Secretary of Housing and Urban Development Henry Cisneros under a cloud of FBI investigation at the end of Bill’s first term, Cuomo took over as Secretary of HUD. You know the rest of the story. Of all the faithful, McAuliffe is the last vestigial limb of what once was a Democratic dynasty.

To understand what the end of that dynasty means, one has to understand the damage the Clintons did to their own party. It was in part Hillary’s willingness to stay silent that allowed Bill to escape being removed from office for perjury and overall conduct unbecoming. Hillary got her pound of flesh, a walk-on coronation as a New York senator (it was Terry McAuliffe who in 1999 personally guaranteed the mortgage on the New York home the Clintons bought so Hillary could claim residency), which would be her springboard to the White House. She consistently voted with the political winds of the day for wars, free from any morality.

When Barack Obama whooped Hillary in 2008, she took SecState as an obvious consolation prize alongside a fairly certain promise she would be the Democratic candidate when Obama retired (sorry, Joe, tonight ain’t your night, kid.) She taught a generation of women and girls to have no self-respect, no honor, take whatever your man deals out with over-done smiles and understated pearls, and have nothing but appetite.

Hillary’s destruction of the Democratic party continued with the political castration of Bernie Sanders. Love him or hate him, Sanders represented what is likely to be the last true set of original ideas presented by a mainstream candidate. The Democratic party’s willingness to destroy Sanders to press Hillary into the nomination left a whole generation of Sanders supporters, the youths which should be today coming into their own as the party base, bitter, disenfranchised, and lost, chasing political memes of the day—this week climate, next week transwoman athletes’ rights, maybe then safe spaces for vegan cookies in schools.

Hillary casually threw away rural voters, once a Democratic mainstay, practically demanding they vote for her opponent after she dismissed them as deplorables. She welcomed silly social justice into the party thinking she was building herself a new base. She made the Democrats wholly dependent on the notoriously unreliable black vote. And then Hillary lost to Donald Trump.

What happened next was a void in Democratic leadership. The party went insane, with Nancy Pelosi and her crowd becoming serially addicted to impeachment and a collection of political curiosities like AOC and the Squad elevated to some sort of odd status (be very loud but accomplish nothing) by the media. It was clear no one was in charge.

Democratic election strategy became a carnival game of try and dunk Trump. Mueller threw a few balls, until the game broke down into a free for all featuring a quasi-coup attempt over a phone call to the Ukrainian president and graphic descriptions of Trump’s genitals by Stormy Daniels. It all ended absurdly with Trump being impeached as president after he left office for inciting an insurrection that didn’t happen.

In the background, the Democratic party imploded searching for its next nominee, with people like Beto the Clueless Cowboy headlining for a few weeks, then a local mayor who got some tailwind out of being gay, and whatever Andrew Yang was supposed to be. That no one was in charge post-Clintons was finally made clear when the system coughed up a crash test dummy like Joe Biden as the best it could manage and then limped into office thanks to Covid fear and media fealty.

That scenario won’t happen twice. White women in Virginia recorded a 15 point voting swing to the GOP in the gubernatorial election compared to the 2020 presidential. The setbacks in heavily suburban blue Virginia suggest a backlash to the whining about race and identity championed by Democrats. These voters are not white supremacists and to label them as such is to dismiss a parent’s rightful desire to see their child get the best possible education. The Dems campaigned on visible contempt for the people in calling them haters and racists needing to have their children saved. Dems went too far and lost Virginia. It wasn’t about Trump, it was about them.

The Democrats have a chance to try again. McAuliffe’s defeat frees them from the last of the Clinton influence, an empowering marker that it is safe to finally leave Bill and Hillary behind. McAuliffe’s defeat, based on social justice issues like trans-everything and racism-everything losing to common sense, can be equally empowering, freeing the party from having to listen to people like the Squad ever again.

Nobody wants to see Biden run for a second term, and Democrats know there is equally little support for Kamala Harris (reminder to all, she is still officially listed as vice president). The Dems, finally, have a chance to find a real candidate. A first sign they see the light might be turning to jobs, Covid, inflation, and the supply chain, indicating they do understand there are voters outside Brooklyn and the Bay Area who care deeply about things other than climate change.

Call it centrist if you like, though realist is a better word. If all the Dems have going into the midterms is some renamed schoolhouses and recycled anti-Trump rhetoric (Van Jones said of the Virginia loss that “Glenn Youngkin represents the delta variant of Trumpism,”) then why would anyone vote for them?

The Dems need the equivalent of drinking clear soup for a few days, now that McAuliffe is out. Or they can eat another couple of Clintonite chili dogs at the first sign of feeling better and get sick all over again.

Still less room is there for those who deride or slight what is done by those who actually bear the brunt of the day; nor yet for those others who always profess that they would like to take action, if only the conditions of life were not exactly what they actually are. The man who does nothing cuts the same sordid figure in the pages of history, whether he be cynic, or fop, or voluptuary. There is little use for the being whose tepid soul knows nothing of the great and generous emotion, of the high pride, the stern belief, the lofty enthusiasm, of the men who quell the storm and ride the thunder. —Theodore Roosevelt, the Sorbonne, April 23, 1910

The primary value of a conference is not found in its addresses or panel discussions, but in the not so simple act of getting the right people in a room together. Much of the good work is done over dinner, or in buying someone a drink at the hotel bar. Those are the real opportunities to confer, and the stuff of schedules is an assistant and springboard to these conversations.

The second National Conservatism Conference, held in Orlando this time—Florida being a free state in the Covid empire, while the District of Columbia is neither free nor, thankfully still, a state—was a highly successful conference. Yoram Hazony and his Edmund Burke Foundation brought a big tent of people together, and let them talk. In doing so, he reminded everyone that they do not labor alone, wherever they labor; that in the work to restore sanity to an increasingly deranged Western public life, to protect this country’s sovereignty and history from its own establishment, they have allies and co-belligerents.

I say co-belligerents because it is not clear yet what it would mean for everyone present to actually be a national conservative. They all appeared to wish to conserve the possibility of an American nation, and agreed that this at least meant rejecting a woke political theology that appears intent on dividing citizens from citizens, reducing us to demographic and sociological categories, felt cartoon characters on a Sunday school flannelgraph made up of historical sins that cannot be expiated or forgiven. But the camp is being built; it is not yet built. It has leaders, but not yet a leader.

Peter Thiel is one of national conservatism’s leaders, and opened the conference. His remarks successfully set the tone of the rest of the week for me, and set up the quandary at the heart of the endeavor. The core of Thiel’s comments was the problem of the individual and a consensus theory of truth. The crowd can be mad, not wise. The individual who stands alone against the mob, even and perhaps especially when they speak the truth, is likely to be squashed, flogged—Glaucon and Girard might suggest crucified. In a line I think I’ve heard from the futurist before, Thiel remarked, “When you get to 99.9 percent, maybe that’s totally right or maybe that’s North Korea.”

The triumph of a certain version of liberal democracy in America and around the world has produced in the Davos class what Thiel described as the worst sort of mob. Globalism and globalization (which find nations undesirable and unnecessary in all their messy particularity of history and culture), a homogenizing, braindead, one-world state—that is the enemy. It is a world in which individuals as persons do not exist, no longer needed; they have been replaced by representative managerial units. It will necessarily fail, and is failing, as the last two years have shown, for in its epistemic closure it will bring about its own collapse, having ignored all those prophets who might have saved what parts of this construction were ever worth saving. “The hour is late for all these institutions,” Thiel said.

To stave off further decline, Peter Thiel hopes for a return of a more confident America, “a country in which we have ticker tape parades for single individuals.” E pluribus unum. If we invite them to, great persons can step forward from we the people, to lead, to teach, to give us wonders again.

The institutions are failing. We need supremely able individuals. This is the bind national conservatism finds itself in, in the year 2021. It is not a presidential election year, or even a midterm year. It is a time for building and waiting. That means it is a time for institutions, for ideas, for policies and for plans. But in the end, all this must rest on persons, for it is individuals who can exercise power with prudence and take responsibility for the power they exercise.

It is hard to build a team without a team captain, and for now, those sympathetic to national conservatism will have to wait for a worthy captain to present himself. In the meantime, they must do their best to become worthy to advise and assist him, and to help those leaders that are already at bat. To counter the homogenizing, networked power of an entrenched establishment, though, requires personalities who can operate levers, not just further machination. The danger is that in constructing some edifice of institutions new and old, white papers and policy briefs both innovative and time-tested, the Brahmins of national conservatism will leave too small a man-shaped hole for the parade-worthy individuals Thiel spoke about. Then when magnanimity steps forward to the call of the hour anyway, and bends their carefully laid plans to make a way large enough to enter the arena, these theorists of renewal will find themselves filled more with distaste and displeasure than energy and hope.

If the first NatCon in the Beltway of 2019 had a more confident spirit than post-Covid Orlando, that was in large part because Donald Trump stood—strikingly light on his feet, chest protruding, arms extended wide—ready to have the robes and armor of national conservatism laid upon his shoulders and girded at his waist, fitted to him as he strode forth into a second term. Now, cast out of the White House, conservatives must look where they should have been looking already, to the states and local politics for victories and change to the status quo.

Fortunately, there are individuals who have already answered the call, men like Chris Rufo, who has taken on the burden of providing focus and language for the revolution against critical race theory in schools and workplaces. Rufo is playing hardball, for keeps, at every level of society, and has won in corporate boardrooms as well as the Virginia governor’s mansion and public school parents meetings. He and persons like him are the future of national conservatism. It is on the institutions and wonks to ask how they can help."

Kennedy Main Justice Building on November 08, 2021 in Washington, D.C. (Photo by Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images)

When Merrick Garland was appointed attorney general, there was a widespread belief that as a person acclaimed as a “moderate,” he would be a restraining influence on the more exuberant progressives in the Biden administration. This was an unrealistic expectation.

Garland’s reputation for moderation arose from his gentlemanly and modest demeanor, exhibited during the abortive effort to confirm him to the Supreme Court, and from his willingness to uphold some of the more noted excesses of the Second Bush administration during the so-called War on Terror that Bush regarded as his political meal ticket. Garland, as the federal prosecutor of the Oklahoma City bombing, had understandably strong emotions about terrorism.

The president’s appointments to the civil rights agencies within and outside the Justice Department, however, reflect no restraining influence on Garland’s part, including as they do Pamela Karlan, a sponsor of abortion cases and critic of Milliken v. Bradley and San Antonio v. Rodriguez; Vanita Gupta, a leading advocate of police consent decrees, including the disastrous one in Baltimore; Catherine Lhamon, author of the notorious “dear colleague” letter urging that students accused of sexual harassment be stripped of rights of cross examination and their accusers be made to carry only lenient burdens of proof; and Suzanne Goldberg, also a critic of the revised campus assault rules adopted by the DeVos Education Department and upheld by the courts.

Garland has gone on to authorize attacks on Texas and Georgia election laws. One of the laws attacked limits assistance to disabled voters in polling booths and the attack effectively is designed to support orchestrated early voting by senile and frequently incompetent voters bussed in from nursing homes; another imposes neutral formalities on mail ballots, a safeguard against vote-buying. Limitations on the provision of water and food to voters standing in line are assailed; although a different view might be taken if this controversy had been precipitated by Republicans providing elaborate box lunches to suburban voters. Limits on drop boxes are attacked, although the reason for them is that the use of drop boxes vitiates efforts to prevent “ballot harvesting” by requiring absentee ballots to be delivered one at a time by relatives of the voter. It is alleged that these limitations have a disparate impact on minority voters. That can also be said of the use of the secret ballot itself, designed to disrupt the pressures once brought by nativist and other political machines when votes were cast in the open. Certainly these lawsuits are not without partisan taint.

Garland has authorized the Justice Department’s gratuitous intervention in the Texas abortion case. Ignoring standing and “case and controversy” limitations, the Justice Department asserted what amounted to a claim for Supreme Court veto of state legislation, proposals for which were three times rejected at the Constitutional Convention. The new solicitor general’s argument against the law relied on three cases long viewed as the most extravagant reaches of federal judicial authority: Debs, about which Attorney General Edward Levi was a notable sceptic; Cooper v. Aaron, whose supremacist rhetoric in the cause of civil rights evoked an anguished concurrence from Justice Frankfurter; and Shelley v. Kraemer, whose assault on private covenants as “indiscriminate impositions of inequality” was admitted to be incoherent by Francis Allen, Chief Justice Vinson’s law clerk and the probable author of the opinion. Even in the heyday of the 1960s civil rights movement, its leading lawyers, including Burke Marshall and John Doar, were careful to rest regulations of private behavior on the Commerce Clause, not the 14th Amendment.

The Justice Department’s intervention in litigation over school masking, school board deliberations, and Covid-19 testing is likewise hard to justify. The Trump administration was not presided over by a philosopher king, but Trump had the good sense to leave both the imposition of lockdowns and the re-opening of businesses entirely to state and local governments, equipped to assess local risks and conditions. This produced disease rates somewhat less than those of most foreign countries, and less damage to the economy. It also prevented Covid responses from becoming a starkly partisan issue right away. The new efforts to impose national rules are doing just that, and are almost certainly counterproductive as a means of raising vaccination rates. As the experience of the fugitive slave clauses, alcohol prohibition, and the drug war attests, Americans tend to resist sumptuary legislation overriding state and local preferences.

Recent Democratic administrations tend to assume that any cause clad in the mantle of civil rights is the appropriate subject of federal judicial, legislative, or executive action. There is a tendency to forget that the heroic judicial measures on behalf of black Americans in the 1960s appealed for their justification to Chief Justice Stone’s opinion in the Carolene Products case, with its reference to “prejudice against discrete and insular minorities… curtail[ing] the operation of those political processes ordinarily to be relied upon to protect minorities.” This scarcely describes a condition in which the black vote dominates Democratic primaries in most Southern and Border states and in many large cities.

The Justice Department’s recent culture war adventures could not be better calculated to generate and perpetuate the mistrust and division successfully exploited by former President Trump. Some words of a successful constitution-maker about the separation of powers should be heeded. Charles De Gaulle, the founder of the Fifth French Republic, with its successful constitution, wrote in the last volume of his memoirs, published in 1962 “before the flood”:

America… has only two parties, which are opposed on none of the fundamental issues—nationhood, moral law, institutions, defense, freedom, ownership. It is a federation of states each of which, with its governor, its representatives, its judges, and its officials—all elected—takes upon itself responsibility for a large part of the immediate business of politics, administration, justice, public order, economy, health, education, etc. while the central government and Congress normally confine themselves to larger matters: foreign policy, civic rights and duties,, defense, currency, overall taxes and tariffs. For these reasons, the system has succeeded in functioning up to now in the north of the New World. But where would it leave France, … a country the demands of whose unity coupled with the perpetual threats from outside have induced to centralize its administration to the utmost, thus making it ipso facto the target of every grievance?… The inevitable result would be either the submission of the President to the demands of the deputies or else a pronunciamento.

To these cautionary words should be added the warnings of Justice Jackson, in his last book, his oral history, and elsewhere, of the dangers of expanded federal criminal jurisdiction to the American system of government.

The United States has had three notable modern attorneys general: George Wickersham, Robert Jackson, and Edward Levi. Enough has been seen to determine Merrick Garland will not take a place among them.

George Liebmann is president of the Library Company of the Baltimore Bar and the author of The Common Law Tradition: A Collective Portrait of Five Legal Scholars (Transaction Books, 2005), one of them Edward Levi."

Despite their numerous adverse effects, Covid lockdowns forced many to rethink their priorities. Many women found that working 9-to-5 in a cubicle wasn’t as fulfilling as they were once told.

“Nearly 3 million U.S. women have dropped out of the labor force in the past year,” one CBS News headline reads. While many of these women may have been furloughed or laid off due to the economic devastation wrought by the lockdowns, others likely reconnected with their children and husbands while working from home and found that this was, after all, quite fulfilling, despite having been told this would turn them into hopeless tools of the patriarchy.

“Cottagecore” also took off during the pandemic lockdowns. The internet-trendy word describes an aesthetic marked by, among other things, long floral dresses reminiscent of a more simple, self-sustaining lifestyle. Cottagecore has become surprisingly popular in our feminism-steeped culture. As Elle Reynolds wrote at the Federalist earlier this year, “Worlds away from Hillary Clinton’s pantsuits or Kamala Harris’ Converse, this fashion trend runs toward feminine tropes that have been mocked as outdated.”

Taylor Swift’s albums folklore and evermore, released, respectively, in July and December of 2020, also manifested this cottagecore aesthetic. Like her fans, Swift seemed able to step away from the hustle and bustle of modern commercial life during the early days of the pandemic and reflect on what she really loved. Swift said of folklore, upon its release, “In isolation, my imagination has run wild and this album is the result, a collection of songs and stories that flowed like a stream of consciousness.”

And when Swift allowed her imagination to run wild, what came out was something which, surprisingly for Swift, appeared quite traditionally feminine. The back cover of the album featured Swift with her hair braided into low buns reminiscent of American girl dolls, as she donned long flowing dresses and stepped out into the woods. For Swift’s live performance of “august” at the Grammys, the singer wore a head-to-toe floral gown with hardly an inch of extra skin showing. Similarly, the artwork for evermore depicted Swift with her long hair in a loose French braid. This Taylor was a far cry from the libertine Swift we saw in the music video for “Are You Ready for It” or “Look What You Made Me Do” off her 2017 album Reputation.

Now the singer-songwriter is re-releasing improved and updated versions of her old albums, with her 2012 album Red re-released earlier this month. Swift hasn’t returned to her Reputation era dripping sexuality, at least not yet, and it’s possible the aesthetic of folklore and evermore, as well as some of her earlier albums, is here to stay. Regardless, Swift’s, and by extension her fans’s, relationship with femininity is worth exploring.

Swift’s flirtation with the softer side of femininity obviously clashes with her earned reputation as a feminist icon, but the traditional notes of her music have long been hard to miss. Long before folklore and evermore, many of Taylor’s songs were far from claiming casual sex and serial monogamy as fun, if not empowering. In “Love Story,” the song’s female protagonist cries out for “Romeo” to “save me” and the song ends with him proposing marriage to her, after asking her father’s permission.

Several of Taylor’s most gut-wrenching breakup ballads mourn the loss of innocence they represented for the often-autobiographical songwriter. This, even as Swift herself espouses an ideology that says women can, and should, have numerous sexual partners with little to no emotional involvement.

When Swift shot into fame at 17 years old, her music, lyrics, and style followed that of early 2000’s country music. Usually wearing playful dresses with golden curls grown long, Swift strummed to songs about heartbreak in small towns and high school crushes. After disastrous relationships with Hollywood stars several years her senior—famously, Jake Gyllenhaal and John Mayer, among others—Swift shifted to a more rebellious, promiscuous, and politically activist overtone, with albums such as 1989, Reputation, and Lover.

But in her two 2020 albums, Swift ditches her vengeful tell-all lyrics about past lovers for circumspect reflection on such failed relationships. Where “Blank Space” glorified female promiscuity (“Grab your passport and my hand/I can make the bad guys good for a weekend”) one song on evermore tells the story of a young woman who dreams of marrying and having ten children with her boyfriend. In contrast with “willow,” Swift’s “The Man” sounds almost forced. How could the same woman who sings, “I’m so sick of running as fast as I can/Wondering if I’d get there quicker/If I was a man,” also sing, “Wherever you stray/I follow/I’m begging for you to take my hand/Wreck my plans/That’s my man.”

While it is, of course, impossible to ascertain and erroneous to assume that Swift is at all personally “conservative,” in any meaningful sense of the word, her popularity amongst women makes her lately traditional aesthetic and lyrics worth noting.

It’s as if Swift and many of her female fans are too busy convincing themselves of a certain vision of “powerful” womanhood to have truly noticed how much they really yearn for a more traditional femininity. One can only hope that Taylor’s dalliance with tradition is here to stay, and that her female fans realize that making “the bad guys good for a weekend” pales in comparison to settling down with your own Romeo. After all, in the latter case, “You’ll never have to be alone.”

But things are getting worse, not better. In my lifetime “Halloween” has become a season unto itself, one that lasts from about the end of August until the first Christmas decorations begin to appear (roughly) on All Souls Day. Meanwhile, even thoroughgoingly secular holidays such as Thanksgiving have been transformed beyond recognition. How I long now for those halcyon days when the annual humiliation of the Detroit Lions on national television was the mere vigil of one of the high feasts of GDP growth instead of the end of a month-long inducement to purchase worthless Chinese plastic.

I could go on in this vein indefinitely, but facts must be faced. The American people are desperate for something to celebrate between the vigil of All Saints and the fourth Thursday in November. Which is why I am proposing a new holiday, one that will in fact be celebrated twice a year.

Before I continue, I should make it clear that the “Festival of Incompetence,” which I propose that we observe at the beginning and ending of Daylight Savings Time on the second Monday in March and the last Sunday in November respectively, was originally my wife’s idea. Like most American parents she and I spend roughly a third of the year trying to adjust our children to this pointless scheme of meddling with clocks.

There’s nothing we can do about Daylight Savings Time. This is true even though it would be difficult to think of another national policy with fewer defenders. In fact, I have never met a single person who believed that it was worthwhile, and I doubt such a person exists. This is exactly why it is never going away—that’s how these things always work. (An actually popular or worthwhile undertaking on the other hand…)

Hence, in the spirit of jubilant resignation, the Festival of Incompetence (or FOI for short), a biannual celebration not only of Daylight Savings Time but of all the absurdities, stupidities, inanities, blunders, and obvious errors visited upon us by forces beyond our control: not only federal, state, and local government but also major corporations, educational institutions, sports leagues, hospitals, dioceses, and departments of fish and game.

The great thing about FOI is that, like All Saints, when we commemorate both the great saints of the canon and the comparatively humble objects of local cults, it combines the universal and the particular. No two people will celebrate it in the same manner. We can of course all acknowledge the monumental follies of our age—the so-called liturgical reform, the system of de facto indentured servitude that we fondly refer to as “higher education,” the decline in building materials, textiles, and the quality of other consumer goods, the eradication of our industrial base, the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, so-called “airport” security, smoking bans, mobile phones, the two-part legalization of cannabis, the successive rounds of Covid theater during the last two years (can you believe it has been that long?)—but what about those other winsome little acts of stupidity we are all forced to put up with?

Think of the poorly designed highway merge where you have a decidedly non-zero chance of being killed during your daily commute, the ugliest municipal building in your city or town, your least favorite corporate telephone menu or online customer service portal. Recall with especial relish the longest conversation you have ever had with a representative of your employer-sponsored insurance company—the indescribably sweet feeling of being told after waiting on hold for an hour, having the call disconnected the moment you finally reach an agent, and reconnecting that the mistake is the hospital’s fault and you need to contact their billing department. Think of how you felt when you last renewed your driver’s license or paid your water and sewer bill in person and were told that your state or city assesses a $7 fee for the use of a credit or debit card, as if it were 1972 and these little pieces of plastic were some unheard-of inconvenient commodity.

So much for the matter. In what manner should FOI be celebrated, you might ask? Here it will do me no good to be overly prescriptive, lest I find myself an object of mirth (“Here’s to Walther, who made FOI the worst holiday since Flag Day with his lame drinking tradition!”). Still, a few suggestions are perhaps in order:

Games, such as “How much did it cost?” (a pointless but one hopes amusingly ritualized attempt to answer questions like why your city council forced the library system to buy a dilapidated building that it had paid too much for years earlier when the downtown bank decamped for a plaza off the highway) or “Ontology of the catch” (an NFL-themed investigation into changed attitudes about metaphysics).

Decorations, e.g., banners replete with misspellings or gibberish English of the kind familiar to anyone who has purchased a child’s swimming toy from Amazon or read an instruction manual purchased in the last year; or, for the more ambitious, deliberately sloppy home improvement projects that remind you of municipal contracting, McMansions, or the bathroom of your favorite fast food franchise—constructing a birdhouse with multiple overlapping facades of at least three different materials (preferably at least one of them fake brick veneer).

Special food and drink: One idea is to commemorate the retirement of the most recent iteration of the food pyramid (remember when people thought that Cheerios were better for you than farm-fresh eggs?) or the gradual evolution of ever-more harmful substitutes for animal fat. Another is to see how quickly you and your friends can become what the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention define as “problem drinkers,” viz., a woman who drinks more than one alcoholic beverage per day.

All of these played some role in my own family’s inaugural celebration of FOI this year. Here’s hoping the rest of you will join us in March.

Speaking to the… [+7608 chars]",Right,"Discontent in American public life has struck a resounding cord across the political spectrum. Speaking to the American crisis, Yoni Appelbaum has pinpointed a significant feature of the problem for the Atlantic: We have not only lost trust in our democratic institutions. We seem to have given up the habit and practice of democracy itself.

While we will be quick to point to a set of proximate occurrences as the cause of this bipartisan gloom, there is a more remote feature of our present condition that is often neglected. We need to pay closer attention to an overarching narrative, a story that American citizens have been taught to believe, and which in its own incoherence provides a more coherent explanation for our current discontent.

Liberalism does not simply entail a set of philosophical and political principles that can be drawn to their logical conclusions. Rather, liberalism is a tale that helps democratic citizens understand themselves and their place in this world. When we better grasp some of the essential features of this story, we can perhaps catch a glimpse of what is happening today in American social and political life.

The first principle of the liberal narrative, the one in crisis, is this: Liberalism inaugurated the necessary division between the religious and political spheres, which is the cause of universal flourishing and societal peace. The powerful influence of this tale can be seen by looking at two particular instantiations of its telling.

One comes from Harvard psychologist Steven Pinker. Pinker argued in his recent work, Enlightenment Now, that the world has improved in almost every measurable area of human life for the past three centuries, and that said progress is only continuing. The central argument that Pinker presents is meant to push against a resurgent narrative of decline in American social and political thought, spanning both the left and right. This story contends that the state of the world is not only in a condition of angst, but experiencing a serious existential and social crisis stemming from tenets of liberalism itself.

The progress that Pinker sees throughout the world—the astounding decline of poverty, war, disease, and famine, and the vast increase of wealth, equality, and democracy across the globe—is said to owe its success to the ideas laid down by Enlightenment thinkers. For Pinker, “our ancestors replaced dogma, tradition and authority with reason, debate and institutions of truth-seeking. They replaced superstition and magic with science. And they shifted their values from the glory of the tribe, nation, race, class, or faith toward universal human flourishing.”

The attempted substitution of religious authority with science and universal human flourishing constitutes a revolutionary paradigm shift. In his book The Stillborn God: Religion, Politics, and the Modern West, Columbia professor Mark Lilla elucidates a second component of this narrative feature, which concerns the novelty of modern thought. According to Lilla,

The first modern philosophers hoped to change the practices of Christian politics…By attacking Christian political theology and denying its legitimacy, the new philosophy simultaneously challenged the basic principles on which authority had been justified in most societies in history…The ambition of the new philosophy was to develop habits of thinking and talking about politics exclusively in human terms, without appeal to divine revelation or cosmological speculation.

We must admit the claim that liberalism brought about a needed division between the religious and political spheres has some truth to it. And yet, at a deeper level this narrative of liberalism neglects the fact that political theology is still alive today, albeit in a distorted and rather crippling manner. Whether we are speaking of climate change, racism, or economic justice, our political thinking has ultimately become a dialectic between the “innocent” and the “stained.” A new public theology has emerged, wherein one must constantly display an appearance of being a victim. Those that are not able to play a victim, then, are made akin to Covid-19, a disease needing to be eradicated at all costs.

The shift that is identity politics is not merely a new form of religion. This common contention usurps its own self-understanding. Identity politics is not only a set of doctrines but is patently liturgical. The pseudo-liturgical activity of identity politics reveals its connection to the new condition of modern man. Its worship is made visible in public denunciations of illiberalism, racism, xenophobia, hatred, privilege. Worship is nourished by its nominal telos whereby humanity become witness to the final overcoming of all forms of discrimination and oppression. The vitality and tenacity of identity politics becomes intelligible by seeing it within this deracinated liturgical context.

In other words, there is an aspect in which liberalism has ushered in its own sacramental vision, where religion and politics have again become joined together. Liberalism, then, is manifest precisely as a theology. Some would argue it always was.

So how is it that we might respond to the union of religion and politics? As part of a broader approach, a first step would seem to entail the actual desacralization of the political. In Christianity, the salvific message of Jesus Christ transcends the political; salvation is not dependent upon the condition of one’s political society. The fullest meaning of the Christian faith ensures that the spread of its healing doctrine not be tied to any one political regime. To be a citizen of a particular political order does not make or break one’s eternal beatitude.

Alongside this theological principle, as Augustine argues in the City of God, is the realist recognition that all earthly regimes will fall short of justice. This is why Augustine drew such a sharp distinction between the City of God and the City of Man. The City of God was not the earthly church, but a transpolitical reality, something to which human beings are ordered as their ultimate end. Following in the footsteps of Plato and the classical tradition of political philosophy, Augustine believed that it was necessary to ask what the best regime would be, or is under eternity. Yet, he also agreed with Plato that such a perfect regime is impossible to create in this life, and that attempting to bring it about would destroy actual regimes.

In conjunction with Augustine, talk of a Christian regime should be approached with great prudence and a deep caution. The temptation to guard against is a sort of “re-enchanted” nationalism, even under the guise of Christianity. The City of God is not an attempt to undermine the need for the embodied realities of home and political life. Rather, the nuance or caveat is to say that the City of God offered by Christ as witnessed in the Gospel is ultimate. The desire and orientation towards this Ultimate Home can become eclipsed even in the attempt to recover the goodness of home and attachment in this world.

We need to recover an account of divine revelation that can counter the worst tendencies of sacralizing political life. As part of the larger narrative of revelation, politics has an opportunity to be put in its rightful place, one where the political cannot become a metaphysics or a pseudo-religion. For the Christian, salvation is not a political project. Our life is meant to be an incarnation of the God who became man. This is always the Christian vocation, no matter in which regime we may find ourselves.

As counterintuitive as it may seem, Americans have become accustomed to a strong vice president.

From neighboring Tennessee, Al Gore (veep from 1993-2001) was the Arkansan Bill Clinton’s Mississippi River brother of a sort… wonkish and weird, he was Gordon Brown to Clinton’s Tony Blair: It was one whole New Democrat package. It was enough to carry Al Jr. through Clinton’s impeachment (the president’s peccadillos offended the more buttoned-up Gore—though, who’s still married?)

When Gore narrowly and protractedly lost the presidency himself in 2000, it was the Democratic fringes who cried that an election was stolen. He was plausible presidential candidate through 2004 and 2008, and became the de facto Climate Man of the decade, in what may yet become the issue of the century, securing the quite arguably limp figure a true human legacy.

Dick Cheney (second chair from 2001-2009) was, of course, Dick Cheney.

Darth Vader himself, or so it’s said, was the anchoring force behind the cause of which this magazine was laudably founded to stand against: that is, the Iraq War. But, say what you will for the man, at least he got something done. From 2001 to 2006, the first year in which President George W. Bush was first delivered a Glenn Youngkin-sized humiliation of his own, Cheney was unassailable, if not essentially the president. Even after his W-delivered defrocking, Cheney was a leading candidate for the 2012 GOP nomination for a time, and his scion, Rep. Liz Cheney, remains perhaps former President Donald Trump’s pluckiest elected enemy. Cheney mattered. He was “BIG.”

His successor, some guy named Joe Biden, became the president. You know about him.

Even Mike Pence, much-maligned, deserves inclusion in the modern canon. Cut on as Mikey-one-note—Trump this, some Reaganite hit that—the Hoosier actually brought a lot to table, electorally and philosophically. As much as I’d like to flak for Chris Christie (Trump’s runner-up choice), it’s difficult to imagine that Trump weathers the Access Hollywood affair without Mr. Evangelical in his back pocket and at the bottom of the ticket.

In office, in terms of what Trump actually did, Pence’s fingerprints were all over it: a tax cut lusted over by House backbenchers like Pence for a generation, a criminal justice plan backed by Koch (a TAC supporter) and Pence’s canny caporegime Marc Short, to say nothing of the 45th president’s Iran policy, which Pence summed up in the final days of that White House: “They’re evil.” If Mike Pence was so unimportant, why would any ever propose hanging him?

Enter Madame Vice President.

Kamala Harris, first truly tipped for glory by Barack Obama in a bizarre retro read of a New Yorker article with David Remnick in the waning days of his presidency…big things were expected of her. From her days as San Francisco Mayor Willie Brown’s date to Frisco’s district attorney at the height of the tech boom, to the Golden State’s top law enforcement official, to its senator, to a presidential candidate with the politics and background that were a worthy, feminine successor to Obama’s own…it was supposed to be her.

When she became vice president, in the delirium of Covid-19 and Trump’s shambolic conclusion of a Washington tenure, her effectively 11th place showing in the 2019-2020 Democratic primary was supposed to be swept under the rug.

Nevermind how it all happened. Assailed as a racist by the California senator during the primary, future President Biden’s selection of a chief lieutenant was an unlikely one. But he boxed himself in. Biden made a pledge of a female (she/her…) vice president to seal the deal in the spring 2020 primary season. When George Floyd met his end, he had to eject his putative favorite, Sen. Amy Klobachur, for reasons both Minnesota and melanin. He needed a black woman—and stat. Biden considered Harris, Angelino Rep. Karen Bass, and Florida’s Congresswoman Val Demings (now prepping to run against Ron DeSantis).

But Biden, the seasoned pol, had a warranted phobia of anyone who had not run and won statewide. Resurfaced tales of Congresswoman Bass, her grandmotherly charm aside, hailing Fidel Castro were reminders of why Congresspeople from D+36 districts don’t usually wind up on national tickets (an interesting counterfactual: What would have happened if Barack Obama had defeated Black Panther Bobby Rush for Congress in 2000?). And Demmings was tossed aside, her career as a cop too outre for the spirit of 2020. Harris, the only female black Democratic senator, got the nod, at last, by default.

She arguably peaked there.

As we near Thanksgiving, Harris has little to thank her lucky stars over. She stands at Cheney-like notoriety, a 27.8 percent approval rating according to Suffolk University. Staff problems were clear, and whispers of frayed relations with The Boss abounded even before the White House’s sudden nosedive since summer. Or as Janan Ganesh puts forward in the Financial Times, arguing for a 2024 Democratic ejection of both Biden and Harris: “Harder to forget is the fact that she quit the party’s 2020 primaries early for lack of funds — some feat for a California senator. Among those who outlasted her was the mayor of Indiana’s fourth-largest city”… that is, perhaps Harris’ top rival, the crisp-as-a-chip, if deflating, Secretary of Transportation Pete Buttigieg.

It’s not hard to conjure up the Harris buy low case: At this point even outright offending British royalty with American garishness, Biden bows out soon enough, and sets the stage for a Harris nomination and a “long and loud” 2024 campaign. The Democratic Party dares America: “Yeah, she’s not great, but are you really in for Trump, the sequel? Dear God.”

So goes the pitch.

But it’s just as easy to dream up the opposite scenario: Both Harris and Biden are overwhelmed by events…Biden suffers the fate of the last most-experienced-guy ever to become president (George H.W. Bush) and somnolently loses re-election…and Harris goes as the elder Bush’s deputy, Dan Quayle, went. Biden has, thus far, done little to save her from this fate, giving the Californian the poison chalice portfolio of the U.S. Southern Border (especially given their party’s de facto open borders preference)… this is on top of the 46th president’s apparent passion for ejecting Harris to peripheral foreign theaters any time things get hot in Washington.

Come the 2024 season, it’s no longer unimaginable that Harris quietly suffers the fate of Quayle when he made his own White House volley in 1996 (this, after all, is what happened Harris the last time America got a full look).

“We were convinced that a winning campaign could have been accomplished and the necessary funds could have been raised,” Quayle, so convincingly, told the New York Times in 1995. Quayle’s legacy ended up being his radical staff, helmed by future Weekly Standard editor Bill Kristol. One only wonders who a future Tucker Carlson (or Tucker Carlson) will be assailing as “some has-been functionary from the Kamala Harris offices in the 2020s” in the future, as Carlson blasted Kristol this week."

Nobody wants to admit that “we may die of Covid” was a better excuse for not getting together last year than “I’m stuck in O’Hare.” Nobody wants to admit that chicken tenders from the microwave and a Friends marathon was actually more fun and way less stressful than cooking a mutant breasted 27 pound bird for 12 hours only to find that it was still a little under done. Even the worst Friends episodes were better than Grandpa Mark’s retelling of the War of 1812 or whatever he was talking about after four Amarettos.

It is thus little surprise that seven out of ten young Americans prefer “Friendsgiving” to Thanksgiving with the fam. Surveys show two out of five young people anticipate biting their tongue during Thanksgiving dinner. It is unclear if they mean holding back on saying something or are actually looking forward to self-inflicted pain as a way to get through the day.

No, this year, because of the Thanksgiving Mandate, it could get ugly. This year it’s family of origin, not family of choice. Here are some survival tips.

For Everyone: Anything with three letters is off-limits: AOC, SNL, NFL, BLM, CRT, CNN, Fox, Joe, vax. Same for anyone known just by a single name: Kyle, Karen, Fauci, Beto, Greta, Brandon, Pete, #, Maddow, Hannity, and unless you have immediate family named “George” or “Floyd,” just no. Same with Loudoun County, unless you actually live there and even then it’s weather only.

Anyone without an advanced degree in the subject cannot discuss how supply lines, inflation, vaccines, or masks work. Microbiology in general is banned as dinner table conversation. Same for anything to do with law in Texas, Atlas Shrugged, Handmaid’s Tale, and 1984. Nobody reads To Kill a Mockingbird or Tom Sawyer now anyway, we just heard about the racist parts somewhere, so skip those, too.

For Younger People: This would be a good time to admit your old man was right when he told you for four years democracy was not dying in darkness, Trump was never going to set up labor camps for LGBTQ illegal immigrant POC refugees, and a few Nazi cosplayers with tiki torches were not the same as Kristallnacht. Set some boundaries for yourself. You are allowed only one eye roll and one snarky remark per holiday gathering, such as when your dad says, “So Trump wasn’t so bad after all” you can reply, if you must, “Neither was Hitler—at first.” But that’s it.

Also youngsters, just let the heaving carcass of the turkey sit untouched on your plate; do not say “I guess no one remembers—again—I’m vegan.” Your parents haven’t seen you in a year, so ease them into that additional ink you spent your stimulus check on. Remember, for your parents your Medusa tattoo is to them what their Trump vote was to you. Save announcements regarding trans anything for later.

If you play nice on all those things you are allowed one bonus exchange over pronouns. And put your phone down. Do not fact check your parents in real time. Spend time not being offended. Pretend it’s organic or keto or paleo enough, Gwyneth Paltrow will forgive you. Basically, lighten up for an afternoon. Accept that your personal life is a side dish for this meal, so have a plan to deal with that. Edibles are a better idea than taking the dog for her fifth long walk of the afternoon.

Psychiatrists tell us traditions and rituals help sustain happiness and family bonds. Remember, Detroit losing and someone making light fun of anything that combines the words marshmallow and salad is a tradition. Calling your parents fascist-AF-misogynist-racists is generally not, even though you did it last year over Facetime. Same with ironic “I’m thankful statements,” so no to “I’m thankful the patriarchy didn’t murder Colin Kaepernick this year.”

Similarly, there is no need to remind the table that “kids in the third world are starving while we eat ourselves into a coma again, I hope everyone is enjoying dessert. I’m not.” Thanks in advance for not introducing the colonialist roots of Thanksgiving and the genocide of the Wampanoag tribe to your younger nieces and nephews over at the kids table. If you can’t handle when grace is being said, just close your eyes and think about how funny Pete Davidson almost is. Also, sorry, 1/6 did not change the world.

For Older Folks: Sorry, 1/6 did not change the world. Set some boundaries for yourself. Only one Dad Joke (suggestion: What did Yoda say when he saw himself in 4K? HDMI.) You are allowed two “I told you so”-s about Russiagate among like-thinking adults before the kids arrive from the airport, and only one in front of the kids. Be magnanimous in victory; serve avocados. Put them on everything. Millennials love avocados. Sigh and accept that your kids do not know any history predating Obama. Just let go of any pop culture references you do not understand.

One exception is Pete Davidson. If any of your children can explain why he is a celebrity, write down their answer and share it with others of us olds. Don’t panic, however, if they retort with, “So you explain why your generation thought Jack Black was funny.” Just be the bigger guy and say that no one knows.

“When are you going to get a real job?” is better stated as “So, your Cousin Mandy said Indeed was a good way to find work in her field, but then again she studied engineering.” Don’t ask “Are you dating anyone?” unless you’re prepared to know more than you really want to know about pansexuality and fluidity over a carb-heavy meal. Instead, try and make your kids feel at home: Use terms like fulfilled, give back, and impactful, and say “research” to mean Googling something. Don’t claim music was better in your day. It was. Your kids will come around to admitting it in a few years but let that slide this holiday season.

For Everyone: For good golly’s sake, remember, they’re your kids. They’re your parents. Kids do stuff, probe boundaries, overreact thinking they’re the first young person ever to notice the Constitution uses only male pronouns, and think podcasts make them experts. Your parents mean well, mis-abled as they are having grown up without social media and irony. They’re good kids. They will figure out the people on late-night TV are comedians, not prophets, well before your second stroke. Your parents tried hard, packed you horrible lunches they thought were nutritious, and thought they were doing the right thing not letting you have the car that night.

Thanksgiving is just one meal built around food nobody likes enough to eat twice a year. It’s a Ron holiday, one for the fun Trans-Am Uncle Joe, so save witchy Nancy and the necro-animated Joe for another date and cut everyone some slack. You never know, next year you might not get to see them. Make it count and save the culture wars for the next phone call.

Now, what happens when you increase the supply to keep up with the demand?

San Francisco may never know, for, as in many other American cities facing housing crunches, a bloc of local politicians has made it their mission to block any new construction if it fails to satisfy a list of must-haves that could put the most ravenous child’s Christmas list to shame. If it earns less than rave reviews in environmental impact reports, is too expensive (whatever that’s supposed to mean in a city where the average one-bedroom apartment goes for over $2,700 a month), smacks of “gentrification,” or otherwise fails to honor “neighborhood character,” it’s a goner. This might explain why from 2012 to 2016, only one housing unit was built for every 6.4 jobs added. A 2015 survey showed that residents recognized the problem, and a majority backed boosting the housing supply by 10 percent—but far fewer supported that new housing being located in their neighborhoods.

Permitting and construction rates have increased since then, thanks in part to a recognition by some officials that the situation was untenable, but it’s not enough, with new development frequently running into opposition from local politicians. Dean Preston, a card-carrying DSA member who holds a seat on San Francisco’s Board of Supervisors, has become the bête noir of Bay Area YIMBY (Yes, In My Backyard) activists who long for more housing. “Dean Preston’s Housing Graveyard,” a new report by several such constituents, outlines a slew of construction projects which Preston opposed: “Preston has blocked or opposed almost all new housing in his district’s wealthy neighborhoods,” the report fumes. Much of the proposed housing would have replaced vacant buildings or parking lots.

By the authors’ count, over his 23-month tenure, Preston has opposed the construction of over 28,700 homes, including nearly 8,500 designated as affordable, and has personally blocked the addition of 8,587 units, almost a quarter of which were to be affordable. (Bear in mind that Preston blames“the market” for the housing crisis.) For his part, the Supervisor has dismissedthe report as “Alice in YIMBY Land” and faulted the authors for not mentioning the 5,000-plus units he hasn’topposed, as well as contending that he didn’t blockhousing so much as he fought for developers to make improvements. After the San Francisco Chroniclecommended the report, he lashed out further, accusingthe publication of being a neoliberal shill for developers, although curiously failing to point to a single falsehood within their reporting.

It’s not just Preston, though. The Board of Supervisors as a whole has shown enmity towards an array of building projects that could have created union jobs and generated hundreds of new homes for low-income San Franciscans. Just last month, they voted eight to three to oppose a new, 495-unit tower to be constructed on a valet parking lot for Nordstrom’s. Rather than simply voting “no,” which could have unlocked an appeals process, they instead requested a new environmental impact report, which could take two years to complete. The vote went against the recommendation of the Planning Commission and even the wishes of the board member in whose district the development was to be built. (The majority said the environmental impact report fell short in addressing earthquake and shadow concerns, and some criticized the proposed development for not being affordable.)

It is common knowledge in the real estate business that if your property or area has a vacancy rate of below 5 percent, the rental market is good for landlords and rents will go up. And this fact has played out over the last 18 months; as remote work became the norm for many employers, workers moved away, vacancies increased, and rents fell to their lowest levels in years. Real estate investors weren’t pleased; when the vacancy rate rose from three to 8.5 percent, the median rent declined by 8 to 12 percentage points. Those lowered rents provide a window into what might have been if housing had kept pace with demand over the years.

As it is, the trends are reverting. Says one property manager from San Francisco:

I think we’re going to see the market rebound pretty quickly because we still have a significant shortage of available housing […] Demand will surpass what it was before Covid within a year, I think, and rents will quickly return to the levels they were, if not higher. (Emphasis added)

One wonders how Public-Housing-or-Nothing activists and development foes, while bemoaning the plight of cash-strapped residents, could conclude that the status quo is preferable to simply stepping back and giving consumers more choices. (To be fair, left-NIMBYs aren’t the only ones enamored of restrictive zoning policies.)

Objections on the grounds of “affordability” of new housing overlook the fact that a vast body of research indicates that adding housing does lower overall housing prices, and slowsdisplacement at both the neighborhood and city-wide levels. Adding affordable housing to higher-income areas is, of course, the quickest route to benefiting lower-income residents, and an increase in housing options might attract some new residents in addition to housing existing ones, but the vast majority of development boosts competition and lowers prices.

This shouldn’t be surprising; when less of a good exists, the price increases. As a friend recently observed, the housing crisis mirrors what we’re now seeing with cars. Production flagged, supply fell, prices skyrocketed, and poorer motorists got squeezed out. Now imagine if the government permanently restricted vehicle production, or banned cars they deemed insufficiently “affordable.”

But even as Bay Area battles rage over housing, there are glimmers of hope for a trans-ideological YIMBY movement out West. A couple of weeks ago, voters in Boulder, Colorado, only narrowly rejected Ballot Question 300—nicknamed “Bedrooms are for People”—which would have overhauled the city’s zoning to permit any house to be resided in by as many bedrooms as it has, plus one. Presently, the city prohibits more than three or four non-relatives from living in the same house, regardless of how many bedrooms it contains, unless residents can get it approved as a co-op.

At first blush, its roster of endorsements—from Out Boulder County to the local DSA chapter—might make conservatives squirm. But it also created some fascinating trans-ideological alliances, among them a litany of unions and the Boulder Chamber of Commerce, each rightly observing that the measure had the potential to offer residents a greater range of housing options. A boosted supply is sorely needed in Boulder, where in the last decade the median home price has nearly doubled and the rental vacancy rate has mostly hovered around 4 percent, according to a Community Profile report.

The measure was no panacea. A variety of residents, not least of all families, might balk at the idea of sharing a house with several non-relatives, and a city memo noted that, if residents took advantage of the new option en masse, public service costs might increase. But new housing is being added at a slow rate: The city saw a net gain of just 28 units in 2018. Although they promisingly approved over 1,000 new building permits that year, more needs to be done to address the housing crunch.

Even back in San Francisco, there is hope. Scott Wiener, an unflinching lefty who represents the city in the state senate, fully recognizes the damage wrought by inhospitality towards new construction, and has fought to slash red tape and incentivize new development—public, private, anything, as long as it gives residents more choices. And voters seem to approve; last year, he cruised to re-election against a development-agnostic opponent. Like Ballot Question 300, Wiener’s prescriptions acknowledge the reality that ill-conceived government intervention is at the heart of today’s housing shortages, and that granting homebuilders more leeway needs to be part of the path forward. Here’s hoping that that’s the outlook that prevails in the years to come.

Wagie wagie get in cagie. All day long you sweat and ragie. NEET is comfy. NEET is cool. NEET is free from work and school. Wagie trapped and wagie dies. NEET eats tendies, sauce, and fries.

This, by some internet wit whose identity was surely deliberately obscured from the first and is now lost to the waves of the world wide web, encapsulates the spirit of idleness that has stricken America’s men. NEET, in case you’ve forgotten, is demographer speak for “not engaged in education, employment, or training.” The NEETs of the internet, and the fakeNEETs of the internet—there are many who only pretend to the nobility of leisure—are of the opinion that wagework today is no deal worth taking. Why race to run the wheel of the post-industrial economy when you can be a free sewer rat? Look at a screen all day in some greige cubicle? We have screens at home.

There were some 16 million men between the ages of 20 and 64 who qualified as NEETs in 2015. That number has surely risen over the last two years of forced business closures, increased unemployment benefits, and general chaos of Covid-19 policies. Work-age men not working has always been understood as something of a social problem; they are volatile, the stuff of pre-revolutionary conditions. “Military age male” is another descriptor sometimes used, when one wants to make a point.

Josh Hawley, the Republican junior senator from Missouri, has caused a bit of a stir since he pointed out the problem America faces here in a speech to the National Conservatism Conference last week. Hawley described a leftist attack on masculinity that has left the American man eager to check out from public life. In the line that has prompted the most scrutiny and sad libertine reaction, he asked, “Can we be surprised that after years of being told they are the problem, that their manhood is the problem, more and more men are withdrawing into the enclave of idleness and pornography and video games?” It seems that in the liberal media, not just among the NEET aristocrats of Reddit, there are many defenders of, if not actually idleness as such (think of the GDP!?), at least pornography and video games.

In a follow up editorial written for National Review online, Hawley wrote: “These habits embody the spiritual emptiness that plagues many men in America today. They fill the void left as men have withdrawn from work, family, community, and the task of self-mastery that it was liberalism’s project to discredit and displace.” The senator has succinctly described the atomization and anomie of mass society in a mass democracy, the appeal of, when there’s little else offered, filling the search for meaning with a personal relationship with mass media.

Work is a drudgery for declining real wages, and school is increasingly by women for women, so why bother? Hawley writes:

But many men have more to offer than test scores can measure, and America needs those virtues: courage, strength, risk-taking, and commitment. These are the virtues that sustain an entrepreneurial and independent republic. But for decades, the Left has been engaged in a social project even more destructive than its economic one. It has pathologized these virtues to suppress the independence they foster. Liberals long ago recognized that independence was a bulwark against tyranny. So they chipped away at it, year after year, by attacking manhood itself.

Virtue, if you’ll bear with the dictionary reminder, is derived from the Latin vir, meaning “man.” Virtus was the Roman word for the specifically manly excellences, those of valor, physical courage, and moral merit. Virtue comes to us through the centuries as an extension of men’s strength to all, and Stanford and Yale Law educated Hawley surely used the word with purpose. He wants to call the country’s men back to being what they as men are supposed to be, fully themselves. He writes, “American men are and can be an unrivaled force for good in the world — if we can strengthen them, if we can empower them, if we can unleash them to be who they are made to be.”

When asked to clarify what he thinks being a man means in an interview with Axios, Hawley replied, “Well, a man is a father. A man is a husband. A man is somebody who takes responsibility.” That’s right, in that a man who is a husband should take responsibility for his marriage, and a man who is a husband should be a father, and a man who is a father should take responsibility for his kids. There are certain virtues required in those roles. But those are roles, and they require certain virtues before they can be assumed and they usually come after employment, education, and training.

If Hawley and conservative leaders want men to grow up, to stop being NEETs, then America’s men need space to develop their virtues. We must understand that there is a circular, organic process at work, for man is an animal. The boy who will master himself, and assume responsibility, must be given the chance to discipline the world around him, to explore the environment he finds himself in, to take dominion of the matter at hand in ways all his own. In this freedom he can fulfill his potential and bring forth his natural capacities as a human being, and, yes, as a man. Only, as the NEET anthem suggests, uncaged, untrapped, can with time and in response to the particulars of his own circumstances the boy be “an unrivaled force for good in the world” and the man he was made to be.

Countering what Christina Hoff Sommers calls “The War Against Boys” in rhetoric only will not be enough to effect this. Boys cannot be cajoled or encouraged into men, for liberalism did not send 16 million men into internal exile simply by henpecking and shrewishness. Rather, it closed all the frontiers, both physical and spiritual. Men, and women too of course, do not need just any work, but meaningful work, fit to them—challenging in a way that summons what is best in them. They do not need or want an education designed to make them ready to conform to an order that finds them fungible, indistinct, and discardable. They are right to buckle at and abandon training that distorts or ignores their essential character—no, not everyone can or should “learn to code.”

Hawley says that the male virtues are vital for a self-governing republic, and this is true. But this is where the organic and circular nature of growth manifests itself again. Those disciplines needed for citizens to rule and be ruled in turn are only called forth when required. Republican virtues spring up and flourish in healthy republics, because that is where space has been made for them, where a frontier has been set forth in which the ambitions of able men can find play for their abilities. We, in this enormous managerial machine we call America today, do not even have that arena, which Abraham Lincoln—no doubt thinking of his own vaunting desires for greatness—worried in his Lyceum Address was still a domain insufficient to satisfy men of “the family of the lion, or the tribe of the eagle,” a human type which “thirsts and burns for distinction; and, if possible, it will have it, whether at the expense of emancipating slaves, or enslaving freemen.”

What is the alternative? What happens if there are no efforts to make an America where men can train and learn and work in ways that honor all that they were created to be? As in many cases, we can look to China. That ancient civilization has, in its recent rush for modern financial prosperity, created a human detritus not unlike our own. The “lying flat” movement has given name to the urge to give up in a game that seems impossible to win. And some equally anonymous Chinese wit, a new Protagoras, has given this mode of life an almost inspiring kind of manifesto, writing:

I haven’t been working for two years, I have just been hanging around and I don’t see anything wrong with this. Pressure mainly comes from comparisons with your peers and the values of the older generation. These pressures keep popping up…But, we don’t have to abide by these (norms). I can live like Diogenes and sleep inside a wooden bucket, enjoying sunshine. I can live like Heraclitus in a cave, thinking about the “logos.” Since this land has never had a school of thought that upholds human subjectivity, I can develop one on my own. Lying down is my philosophical movement. Only through lying flat can humans become the measure of all things.

America can do better. It must."

And only then we order. Try it, it is nice.” That is a civil place. It was not America. America has become an uncivil place.

Almost all of us are convinced this is a broken place; the problem is we differ violently over what is broken, never mind how to fix it. A lot of us are sure our schools are broken. This is a very fundamental thing for a society, as schools teach kids how to live with each other (“values.”) Fundamental things being broken is bad.

But we can’t even come close to agreeing which books to read in English class, never mind whether the whole education system is simply an expression of systemic racism, baked into everything from whose history to tell, to the role of demanding precision in math, to which historical figure’s name is on the school building. These are very big, very fundamental unresolved societal problems. I don’t know of other countries with such problems. I don’t know of any place so unhappy with itself it resorts to intellectual incest as a palliative.

The result is schooling by ideology. The wealthy now choose among private schools tailored to their needs. Middle class families buy their homes based on the public school that comes with them. In urban areas, public education now means warehousing poor kids of color, the school more a place to pass on food and used clothes than knowledge. American children get very different content in their educations, never mind qualities of education. All very separate and very unequal, an idea once rejected by a more civil society. I really thought we had that one beat.

One thing schools used to universally try to do was teach “citizenship,” the role an individual plays in a democracy. The concept must have failed, because few of us believe our elections have much to do with democracy. Too many people have simply given up to the point where if more than half of eligible voters show up for a presidential election it is newsworthy. The election outcome is only fair when our person wins.

The system for choosing a winner has become so complex few of us fully understand it, from registering to vote to redistricting to the Electoral College. The result is a large number seeking ways to manipulate the rules (some justifying modern manipulations because of past manipulations they find unjust), and a large number giving up and voting based simply on social media propaganda. That describes a dying democratic system.

People claiming to want to fix democracy, by using direct election, packing the Supreme Court, or ending the filibuster, are simply whores in a nice dress trying to sell something as progress that will aid only their candidates. The con doesn’t matter, because we no longer expect the truth. Nobody is troubled when the president lies about how many Americans are abandoned in Afghanistan, or asks when the two weeks to flatten the curve will end, or how they can be a valued customer when a company leaves them on hold for 45 minutes.

All of this bleeds over into how we interact with each other. Never mind street fights over Black Lives Matter or scrums at school board meetings. We don’t know how to discuss things, never mind disagree, because we don’t just hate ideas, we have been taught to hate the people who hold those ideas. Commentary is just name calling and junior high-level mocking. Disagreements end with one word pronouncements—racist! fascist!—instead of better ideas put forward.

We’re alone together, loneliness our default state. We avoid physical contact or even proximity with each other, even loved ones, all made so much worse by the dystopian cures for Covid.

We don’t share things. We don’t speak to one another about small problems, we call the manager. When we run out of big issues we spelunk for microaggressions. The range of topics of conversation closes down more and more for fear of offending someone, facing a summons to human resources, or a lawsuit. We discard real world friends on “social” media over the smallest thing. The most common response to an invitation to coffee, or a job application, is ghosting.

We got rid of landlines because their primary purpose morphed into demanding we listen to ads at inconvenient times. Our cell call screening is spoofed so the phone’s primary purpose is to force us to listen to robo ads. Email is a struggle to use because much of it is forced advertising. We don’t check our voicemail because most of it is just forced advertising. We’re afraid to click on an article about insurance for fear our social media will be clogged for days with forced ads.

Our entertainment is mostly social justice memes childishly presented and force-fed to us. There is no way to opt out. We can no longer just ask to be left alone.

We work minimum wage retail jobs that require getting used to suburban women screaming at us because some item in the weekly ad wasn’t in stock. We join in classist gladiatorial sport, testing how businesses care so little about their employees they’ll fire them if one of us makes a scene.

We video everything in hopes of settling matters by embarrassing someone virally. People devote hours to digging through years of history to find something politically incorrect to destroy a life.

Complete strangers profanely yell at us because we aren’t wearing a mask, or have the wrong mask, or are wearing it improperly in their opinion. People we don’t know accuse us of wanting to kill their children with a virus we don’t have.

Others accuse us of hating them, or wanting them dead, if we make a bad word choice (even with the best of intentions, it seems purposefully hard to keep up) to describe their gender or race. Everyone not only thinks this behavior is OK, they believe it to be righteous. They assume ill intent on our side. No more of the sticks and stones rhyme, words are violence now.

Force us together and we bite. Road rage is our national sport. We refer endlessly to “communities” which are just anonymous associations of people online who claim to have been victims of something similar. Our discourse often begins with “As a…” to make clear the separateness of being one gender or another, or of having had the same disease. Our differences become the fuel of victimhood and we loathe solutions that make our victims feel less special. The most spoken sentence in America is now “You have no idea what it’s like to be me because I’m a…”

More often than not the conclusion is violence. In a typical year past, the FAA saw 150 cases of bad passenger behavior. But in 2021 so far the number has jumped to 1,300, ever more remarkable since the number of passengers remains below pre-pandemic levels. Cabin attendants have become less civil alongside their passengers. What they take in abuse they return in passive aggressiveness.

Lack of civility spills over into communal living settings, like condo associations, which come up with increasingly complex rules on how to interact with one another as a stand-in to civility. Boards, elected to handle simple community business like renewing landscape contracts, have turned into bitchy little Vaticans. They create pages of rules about masks and gym use. The answer always seems to try to quantify civility instead of asking for it. As the rules multiply, the residents divide into those with the vice principal’s voice (backed up by the condo’s jailhouse lawyers) versus those who stopped reading after page 49 and just don’t care.

I’ve always loved the line from the Simon and Garfunkel song “Mrs. Robinson” that asks, “Where have you gone Joe DiMaggio?” as the best example of what writers are supposed to do: show, not tell. The line summed up a feeling in America that a better time had passed. We are singing the same song today. Who wants to live like this? Judging by our actions, Americans. Ciao!

Presumably, God sent Covid as a rebuke to the so-called illiberal right.

You know who I’m talking about, don’t you? National conservatives, Catholic integralists, and the like. They read Patrick Deneen and Adrian Vermeule. They fantasize about a Hawley/Vance ticket in 2028. They pine for a strong, right-wing regime—one that will uphold traditional values, revive our national industry, and restore American greatness. Their ideal leader is a cross between Teddy Roosevelt and Charlemagne.

Folks like me.

We’ve spilled a lot of ink talking about the “common good” and other high-minded ideals. We’ve scorned the old alliance between Christian conservatives, civil libertarians, and free-marketeers. Sunday trading and porn would be outlawed again. No-fault divorce would be abolished and child tax credits multiplied. We’ve even talked about raising the minimum wage to a family wage.

Then came the pandemic. Churches that didn’t voluntarily suspend services were usually shut down by the government. In-person commerce was halted around the world by government fiat. Parents were forced to play teacher’s assistant for their kiddos’ Zoom classes. Local officials like Andrew Cuomo sent Covid patients back to their nursing homes and then forced the old folks to “shelter in place,” killing untold thousands. And, of course, citizens were forced to wear face masks whenever they dared to leave their homes.

Our great cities were left looking like Hell in C.S. Lewis’s The Great Divorce: “Time seemed to have paused on that dismal moment when only a few shops have lit up and it is not yet dark enough for their windows to look cheering. And just as the evening never advanced to night, so my walking had never brought me to the better parts of the town.”

Now the Biden administration has imposed a vaccine mandate for the military and wants companies with more than 100 employees to force their workers to get the jab. (For reference, a small Walmart has over 200 employees.) This, despite the fact that many Christians have moral reservations about the vaccines.

And it’s all being done in the name of the common good.

It’s a rude reminder of why older conservatives are so down on Big Government. We probably should have paid them mind.

But does that mean our critique of liberalism was wrong?

If we say yes, we’re saying that liberalism and small government go hand-in-hand. Naturally, it would follow that the advent of liberalism brought about a shrinking of the state. That’s a question for an historian, then, not a political philosopher. And if we look to our history books we’ll see that liberals (quite literally) invented Big Government.

But we can make this reality much clearer if we first make a distinction between authority and power.

It’s true that Europe’s rulers had more authority before the Enlightenment. They claimed for themselves a much larger prerogative than our own republics and democracies do today. Kings took the liberty of smothering heresy, witchcraft, blasphemy, and other acts deemed sinful by the Christian church. They made moral decisions on behalf of their subjects as a father might for his second-grader.

On the other hand, these medieval kings had nothing like the power which our liberal regimes have come to enjoy. They might have claimed a much larger prerogative, but their ability to act upon their will was infinitesimally smaller. As G.K. Chesterton quipped, the feudal tyrant “hanged and burned in quite a small way.”

Which makes sense, when you think about it. During the Middle Ages, there was no real use for large-scale tyranny. The mechanisms of state oppression were designed specifically to impose liberal theories on the peoples of Europe.

During the medieval period, there was virtually no competition between competing worldviews. Wars weren’t fought across ideological lines. It was all a question of whether you happened to pay taxes to John the Bald or Robert the Fat. No: practically speaking, all Europeans believed the same things. They were monarchist in politics, feudalist in economics, Catholic in religion.

Then along came the philosophes. They’d been thinking about it, and they decided the medieval consensus was all wrong. Governments and economies should be organized according to rational principles, not personal loyalties. Kings and lairds should be done away with. So too the Church, which cows the masses with visions of hellfire.

The question is, how do you bring the Enlightenment to the people? The answer: with great care and much violence.

Take the example of France. From the Committee for Public Safety to the reign of Napoleon I, her revolutionary governments sought to completely remake the nation in their own image.

Naturally, the first step was to abolish local government: the rule of local magistrates upholding local customs.

Voltaire once quipped that a man traveling in France “changes his law almost as often as he changes his horses.” This wasn’t really an issue, since Christian kings had abolished the old Roman principle of Ignorantia juris non excusat. If a Norman merchant in Lyon drank wine with his left hand on St. Guinefort’s Day, in violation of Lyonnaise custom, he would almost certainly be let off with a warning. Like good Christians, they tempered their justice with mercy.

Otherwise, most laws were handed down by royal decree. But those decrees traveled so slowly, and at such irregular intervals, that they were essentially moot by the time they reached the local gerent. In the absence of an efficient, centralized regime, towns and villages were left with no choice but to rule themselves. Small Government was the norm because Big Government wasn’t an option.

Nevertheless, that irregularity in local laws and the laxity of local magistrates irritated our philosophes. They sought to revive the old Roman ideal: a legal code based on reason, which could be adopted by (or imposed upon) all civilized peoples. But in order to build their neoclassical republic, the fabric of French society would need to be torn apart. A new France would have to be woven according to the philosophes’ more “rational” vision.

And so, as royalist statesman Pierre Paul Royer-Collard observed, the revolutionaries sought to destroy all of the “true republics within the monarchy.” By this he meant a “crowd of domestic institutions and independent magistracies”—what Burke called the little platoons.

Guilds were abolished. Education was nationalized. Administrative divisions were reorganized. The Revolution swept away these “true republics” and “left only individuals standing.”

That wasn’t the end of it. “From an atomized society has emerged centralization,” Royer-Collard observes:

There is no need to look elsewhere for its origin. Centralization has not arrived with its head erect, with the authority of a principle; rather; it has developed modestly, as a consequence, a necessity. Indeed, where there are only individuals, all business which is not theirs is necessarily public business, the business of the state. Where there are no independent magistrates, there are only agents of central power. That is how we have become an administered people, under the hand of irresponsible civil servants, themselves centralized in the power of which they are agents.

Even the French language was placed under the control of Parisian bureaucrats. As the noisome Abbé Grégoire wrote, “The local dialects, the patois of six million French people who do not speak the national language, will gradually disappear because—and I can’t say it often enough—it is more important politically to eradicate this diversity of coarse idioms, which prolong the infancy of reason and the age of prejudice.” So, under the new liberal regime, regional dialects and accents were systematically eradicated.

Their de-Christianization campaign was even more brutal. Monks and nuns were murdered by the score. Priests were forced to swear loyalty to the government and take a wife. Churches were confiscated and turned into temples for the regime’s state religions, the Culte de la Raison and the Culte de l’Être suprême. The Jacobins even sought to rename every street in the country that was named after a saint.

Napoleon’s liberalism was far less dogmatic, but only because he was more interested in consolidating power than wielding authority. He devoted his reign to building an administrative state the likes of which Europe had never seen. Of course, that meant putting France on a strict regimen of tax hikes and red tape. In his 1819 essay Bourbons and Buonapartes, François-René de Chateaubriand complained:

We have praised Buonaparte’s administration. If administration consists in numerals—if, to govern well, it suffices to know how much a province produces in wheat, wine, and oil, what is the last penny one may levy as tax, the last man one may take—then certainly Buonaparte was a great administrator. It is impossible better to organize evil or put more order into disorder. But if the best administration is that which leaves the people in peace, which nourishes their sentiments of justice and piety, which is frugal with the blood of men, which respects the rights of citizens, their properties and their families, then certainly the government of Buonaparte was the worst of governments.

Napoleon also followed the Jacobins in building up an efficient, centralized police force specializing in domestic surveillance. That force served the House of Bonaparte even during the Second Republic. In 1848, Napoleon’s nephew Louis-Napoleon was elected president. In 1851, he declared himself emperor, though his reign was strikingly like that of a modern dictator—especially in his use of the police to disseminate propaganda and silence dissent.

These naked power-grabs took place all over Europe. True, they weren’t always as bloody as in France. Often enough, they were adopted by monarchs like Frederick II of Prussia or Peter I of Russia. They accepted liberal principles (e.g., religious toleration) in order to build a more efficient, “modern” administration. Today, we call them Enlightened despots, though I’m not sure there could be such a thing as an un-Enlightened despot. As we said, the Enlightenment invented despotism.

Immanuel Kant distinguished himself as the great literary champion of Enlightened despotism. So he wrote,

Enlightenment requires nothing but freedom, and the most innocent of all that may be called freedom: that is, freedom to make public use of one’s reason in all matters. Now, I hear the cry from all sides: “Do not argue!” The officer says: “Do not argue—drill!” The tax collector: “Do not argue—pay!” The pastor: “Do not argue—believe!” Only one ruler in the world says: “Argue as much as you please, but obey!”

Indeed, says Kant,

only the man who is himself enlightened, who is not afraid of shadows, and who commands at the same time a well-disciplined and numerous army as guarantor of public peace—only he can say what [the sovereign of] a free state cannot dare to say: “Argue as much as you like, and about what you like, but obey!”

Every successive government has taken up this mantra, including ours. We’re allowed to think and say anything we like, so long as we don’t presume to act. If we do—well, they can always send in the National Guard.

True, our own Enlightened despots are seldom as brazen as Napoleon. Their propagandists are rarely so explicit as Kant. Yet every liberal regime is gradually consumed by bureaucracy, and as the administrative state expands, so does the temptation to silence dissent.

We see it play out in our own country. It began with the loyalist purges of the Revolutionary period. It continued with Abraham Lincoln’s invasion of the South. Today, the regime uses a combination of political and economic pressure to enforce its ideology—a system described ably by Patrick Deneen in Why Liberalism Failed and by Rod Dreher in Live Not By Lies. Indeed, few pre-modern regimes were so efficient at quashing dissent as the United States government.

The question now is how should the “illiberal right” deal with the liberal Leviathan?

This is where some division may arise within the illiberal ranks. Many would suggest we coopt the superstate for our own purposes. Professor Adrian Vermeule of Harvard Law School is the best-known exponent of this view. In his 2020 essay for The Atlantic, “Beyond Originalism,” Prof. Vermeule calls on Republicans to embrace the Democrats’ total-war strategy. We shouldn’t seek to uphold constitutional government, he says. Rather, we should reeducate the Leviathan “based on the principles that government helps direct persons, associations, and society generally toward the common good.”

Likewise, this past August, American Mind published a striking article called “The Salazar Option.” The author, Christopher Roach, argues that American conservatives should emulate the Portuguese strongman António de Oliveira Salazar. Like Prof. Vermeule, he believes we should use the liberal administrative state to advance a right-wing agenda. “To survive,” says Mr. Roach, “we need to be committed to acquiring and using power in the service of a counterrevolution.”

No doubt there’s some truth in what they say. But I suspect their thinking has much in common with the Very Online royalists who idolize King Louis XIV and Pope Pius V. They imagine an all-powerful (but Christian) regime, where every aspect of public life is controlled by either the State or the Church.

It’s not difficult to see how folks who admire the absolute monarchies of the Renaissance would be intrigued by a figure like Salazar or by Prof. Vermeule’s idea of “integration from within.” But no historian would deny that Renaissance political philosophy is very different from that of the medievals. We can’t obscure the distinction between feudalism and absolutism.

Absolutism is the system defined and defended by 17th century thinkers like Niccolò Machiavelli, Thomas Hobbes, Sir Robert Filmer, and Bishop Jacques-Bénigne Bossuet. It was inspired by the same surge of interest in classical philosophy that eventually gave us the Enlightenment. (No doubt the very heavy-handed theories of government laid out by Plato and Aristotle were accentuated by the Byzantine refugees who carried them to Europe.)

Of course, absolutism also evolved as a bulwark against the proto-liberalism of the Renaissance humanists, much as Enlightened despotism would evolve as a bulwark against republicanism. It was a kind of “Dark Enlightenment,” a humanism shot through with pessimism about human nature. So, for instance, Filmer references Latin texts even more often than does Rousseau. The difference is that, while Rousseau championed Roman republicans, Filmer saw the new absolute monarchies as a rebirth of the Roman Empire.

Feudalism, meanwhile, began to evolve much earlier during the so-called Dark Ages. It was a rejection of Pax Romana—an attempt to forge a Christian statecraft entirely untainted by decadent, pagan tyrannies. It defined itself against the Byzantine Empire, with its all-powerful bureaucracy, which was manned by scheming eunuchs, all of whom ate their supper with forks. In time, defenders of the old feudal model would also quarrel equally with Renaissance absolutism and Enlightenment liberalism, both of which bore hallmarks of Byzantinism.

It’s difficult to define the principles of feudalism because they evolved organically over the course of a millennium or so. But there’s a large body of (admittedly disparate) thinkers who were inspired by the medieval model. All of them would agree with the basic distinction made by Ralph Adams Cram between “the Renaissance monarchies,” which “were so obviously out of key with the principles of justice and liberty,” and “the free kingship of the Middle Ages.”

So, for instance, moderate liberals like Edmund Burke mourned the end of France’s absolutist regime. “But the age of chivalry is gone,” he cried, “and the glory of Europe is extinguished forever.” Ultra-royalists like Joseph de Maistre, on the other hand, lost no love for the effete, autocratic Bourbons. Observing the Reign of Terror, Maistre coldly remarked: “It has been a long time since we have seen such frightful punishment inflicted on such a large number of guilty people. No doubt there are innocents among the unfortunate victims, but they are far fewer than commonly imagined.”

The divide between Burke and Maistre signals a permanent division in the conservative movement. It’s not a hard division, but it’s one that continues to generate confusion on the right.

On the one hand, we have figures who feel at home in the post-medieval order. They’re basically at ease with the administrative State, meaning they see government in terms of power, not authority. They may sympathize with either the Renaissance absolutists, the Enlightened despots, or the liberal republics; perhaps they have a fondness for all three. We’ll call this faction the conservatives.

Burke himself is an obvious example of this tendency. Likewise “neo-absolutists” such as Juan Donoso Cortés and Charles Maurras, who would attempt to revive Filmer’s concept of the dictator-king. We’ll include integralists like Prof. Vermeule in this category as well because they’re not interested in fundamentally altering the administrative State.

On the other hand, we have figures who cannot reconcile themselves to the administrative state in any form. They may or may not be monarchists, but they’re concerned first and foremost with restoring the “true republics within the monarchy” spoken of by Royer-Collard. They’re not libertarians; they believe in authority, in commonwealth. But they believe that power should be decentralized. It should be taken away from the State and given back to smaller, more local institutions: guilds, parishes, city councils, etc. We’ll call them reactionaries.

Reactionaries have even less common ground with Jacobins than do conservatives. Yet, paradoxically, they also tend to be more sympathetic to the French Revolution than conservatives. Some share Maistre’s contempt for the hypocrisy and degeneracy of absolutism. More usual are figures like William Cobbett, G.K. Chesterton, and Hilaire Belloc. All three were deeply inspired by the Middle Ages, though all three also had a tendency to romanticize the Revolution. Yet the reasons they gave for their romanticism are instructive.

For example, we’ve already seen how medieval magistrates did away with the principle “Ignorance of the law excuses not” and prosecuted travelers according to their own custom. This may seem odd, coming from the peoples who erected inquisitions to hound heretics. But, as any honest historian will admit, the inquisitions were designed to save heretics, not to punish them. They allowed heretics to defend themselves at a fair trial, so as to placate the mobs who had otherwise resolved to take justice into their own hands—like the one that tried to stone Peter Abelard at Soissons in 1121.

The vast majority of those prosecuted by the inquisition were acquitted; that included most of those who preached heterodox views about the Christian faith. Inquisitors would readily set a heretic free if he was unlikely to be successful at spreading heresy—if he was stupid, for instance, or ugly.

Which is to say that medieval government was ordered towards not governing. Medieval laws were passed with the implicit desire that they not be enforced.

Likewise, Belloc points out that medieval Christians and paid-up Jacobins both placed “the dignity of man and of the equality of men” at the heart of their political philosophy. And that’s quite true. For instance, while all the land in a medieval kingdom was technically divided among a small number of lairds and vassals, the customs dictating land ownership were so biased in favor of the poor that ownership entailed virtually no control.

Along with the Roman principle of Ignorantia juris non excusat, the medievals did away with the ius abutendi, or “right of abuse.” Feudal lords didn’t have the right to evict their serfs, though serfs could sell land to one another. They could expect a certain percentage of their peasants’ annual yield, in exchange for protecting them from invaders or brigands, but otherwise peasants had free rein of their ten acres. That’s not mentioning their traditional right to take firewood from the laird’s forests, to graze their sheep in his pastures, and so on.

This wasn’t a kind of primitive socialism. It had nothing to do with law and everything to do with custom. Feudalism was a (surprisingly durable) bargain struck between the ruler and the ruled, which ably served the needs of both parties. Every aspect of society was knit together by these informal bonds, which were upheld for the love of—or, at least, the desire for peace with—one’s neighbor.

Are we romanticizing the Middle Ages? Not at all. In fact, the same analysis has long been made even by non-Western observers—and not always flatteringly. The 19th-century tsarist thinker Konstantin Leontiev blamed Catholic feudalism for the rise of liberalism. Western rulers had been too quick to coddle their peasants, he complained. Western feudalism filled the serfs with samouvazheniyu, or self-esteem. They developed a “jittery a sense of their own dignity.” It was only a matter of time until they revolted. Leontiev used the same language to damn the Middle Ages that Chesterton used to praise them.

So here we have the two different models: (A) In the modern world, nations are disparate groups of atomized individuals bound together only by a set of laws. Those laws are ratified by a ruling class and enforced through State violence. (B) In the Middle Ages, folks were bound together in close-knit units by interpersonal loyalty and common custom. The French historian Régine Pernoud neatly summed up feudal Europe as “a society with communitarian leanings, although administered by personal agreements.”

Again, reactionaries are those who instinctively gravitate towards the medieval model. They’re inherently suspicious of large, complicated systems, whether it’s a national welfare system or the global supply chain. They prefer local government and small-scale economies—what the Catholic Church calls solidarity.

And despite their commitment to liberty, they still believe in authority. They would agree with J.R.R. Tolkien that “if we could go back to personal names, it would do a lot of good. Government is an abstract noun meaning the art and process of governing and it should be an offence to write it with a capital G or so to refer to people.”

And they believe that our rulers have a legitimate (if limited) role to play—the role laid out by Chateaubriand: “that which leaves the people in peace, which nourishes their sentiments of justice and piety, which is frugal with the blood of men, which respects the rights of citizens, their properties and their families.”

Examples in the 20th century would be Robert Penn Warren, E.F. Schumacher, and Russell Kirk. In the 21st century we have folks like Wendell Berry, Rod Dreher, Patrick Deneen, Joel Salatin, and Bill Kauffman. They may not think of themselves as reactionary, let alone medieval. Many of them would probably identify with old-school liberalism, as did Chesterton and Belloc. But I think that’s a mistake.

Actually, I think it’s one of the fundamental mistakes of our age. It’s the problem that I have set out here to identify: the false identification of liberalism with freedom and of “illiberalism” with tyranny. As we’ve seen, just the opposite was true. Real tyranny was impossible without liberalism. This cold, dispassionate, “rational” approach to statecraft allowed autocrats like Napoleon and Abraham Lincoln to build administrative states the likes of which the world had never seen.

The cruelest sin of this regime, however, may be the fact that it makes real love of neighbor impossible. Under present circumstances, we can’t forge those informal bonds that undergirded medieval society. We can’t deal with one another in a neighborly way, relying on bonds of charity and honor. Why? Because we’re told not to.

We’re defined by our relationship to the state. Every single economic, political, and social interaction we have with our fellow man is regulated by the state. There’s always some law, regulation, or tax which ensures the government will interpose itself between ourselves and our family, our friends, our neighbor, our countrymen. During the pandemic, we learned that we even need the State’s permission to worship God.

This all-powerful State would delight Caesar Augustus or Emperor Napoleon; to Christendom, it’s repugnant. That is why mere “conservatism” isn’t enough. Integralism isn’t enough. Libertarianism isn’t enough. There’s no point in simply trying to minimize the modern state. We can’t bend it to our will.

You can’t tame the Leviathan. You have to kill it.

Every child in America is assigned Walden in high school. Few students (and fewer teachers) get around to reading it. Yet everyone with an internet connection knows that its author sometimes let his mother do his laundry or bake him pies. As one biographer said, no man has ever been so widely scorned for enjoying a meal with his family.

We love to hate Thoreau. But why? Is it because he failed to live deliberately—“authentically,” as we hipsters say—or because he succeeded? He did spend two years alone in the woods. He built his own cabin and whittled his own bed. He baked his own bread and grew his own beans. Sure, Bear Grylls might not be impressed. But maybe the rest of us should hear him out.

“The mass of men lead lives of quiet desperation,” Thoreau said. Every schoolboy who reads those words nods along vigorously. And he is right, isn’t he?

I kept thinking about the Sage of Walden as I watched Mark Zuckerberg’s guided tour of his new metaverse. Nothing screams “quiet desperation” like a bunch of nerds playing poker in a 3D chat room. It’s like something normal grown-ups would do… except you don’t have to put on pants, or leave the house, or interact with people in real life. When you get tired of your friends you can go into another “room” and look at flying koi fish. Plus you get to be a super-cool robot!!!

Yes, it’s pathetic. But is Mark Zuckerberg really so much weirder than we are? Put it this way. Growing up, I worked as a farmhand. I loved it—except for the summer of my freshman year. I’d pick beans for eight hours a day, grumbling the whole time. All I wanted to do was go home, sit in front of the AC, and check my FarmVille. And I didn’t detect the faintest whiff of irony.

We’re already living in a virtual reality. For years now, social media has been turning us into little Zuckerbots.

No: at the end of the day, we don’t hate Thoreau for his flaws. We hate him for ours. We don’t live deliberately. We lack authenticity. Everything in our lives is cheap, banal, and fake.

Our relationships are fake. Our presence on the internet is perfectly manicured, as are those of our “friends.” We only know each other by our masks. Often enough, we forget what our own faces look like beneath them.

If it’s possible, the “metaverse” is going to make it worse, though I guess that’s a matter of perspective. There’s nothing quite so depressing as seeing a pack of young men walking down the street, marching shoulder-to-shoulder, all looking down at their phones. If the “metaverse” persuades them to stay at home in their parents’ basements, at least they’re less likely to walk in front of my car.

Our sex is fake. Thanks to condoms, contraceptives, and abortion-on-demand, sex has been divorced from its reproductive function. There are still consequences, of course, but they’re not quite so visible. According to one survey, nearly half of all women under the age of 40 have experienced “unwanted slapping, choking, gagging, or spitting during consensual sex”—violent pornography teaches that women enjoy it when men beat them up during sex.

Even if there’s no element of abuse during the act itself, there’s still the potential emotional trauma. Women form emotional bonds with the men they have sex with. They don’t always want to, but they do. That’s why “ghosting” has become such a peril in the dating scene. Actually, women seem embarrassed to admit that a sexual partner can wound them simply by not texting them after a hookup.

Chastity has a certain hard-nosed realism that modern courtship (such as it is) totally lacks. The truth is, there’s no such thing as free love. Childbirth isn’t the only consequence of sex, and the others can’t be “managed” so easily.

Our commerce is also fake. Right now, virtually every sector of the economy is starving for employees. Tens of millions of would-be workers are staying home because they’ve realized they can live off of welfare and Covid-19 “stimulus packages.” In a normal, sane economy, having so many citizens simply refuse to work would cause mass starvation.

Not here—at least, not yet. Since the 1980s, America has been dumping its productive industries on the third world. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, goods-producing sectors comprise about 14 percent of the workforce. For reference, that’s the same as transportation, warehousing, and retail. We employ as many people to sell goods as to make them. That’s unreal. It shouldn’t be possible.

But it is! (At least for now.) Because most jobs in the United States are what David Graeber calls “bullshit jobs”. They’re jobs that no one really wants to do and we don’t actually need anyone to do them. They’re fake jobs. Think of all-night pizza delivery boys, or dog-walkers, or anyone in human resources. These careers are really a form of workfare. They’re not real, either. And if folks think the government will keep sending them checks so that Amazon can deliver their groceries… well, they’re probably right.

(By the way, China draws all of its power by creating the illusion that we can have a prosperous First World economy while only ten percent of adults actually work. We’re Hansel and Gretel; Amazon is the gingerbread house; Xi Jinping is the witch.)

Even our leisure is fake. In his modern classic Bowling Alone, Robert Putnam chronicled the social malaise caused by the decline of civic institutions, labor unions, and social organizations. Some of these institutions may seem silly, like the eponymous bowling leagues. But they formed the bedrock of our democracy. They created bonds of affection and trust between neighbors. They grounded us in a shared experience of the world.

And now? Now the Almighty Screen has destroyed those, too. From Netflix to Xbox, we relax by allowing ourselves to be absorbed into these unreal worlds. Unlike books or boardgames, they don’t require us to use our imagination. In fact, they bypass our conscious minds altogether. They create a state of “radical passivity,” as John Senior put it.

This radical passivity actually alters the way our brains work. As Lenore Skenazy points out in her book Free-Range Kids, someone who binges on crime dramas is going to severely overestimate the likelihood of being murdered. It’s going to seem like a much bigger threat than it really is.

If Law & Order can convince you that everyone you meet in Central Park is a rapist, there’s really no telling how much digital media shapes the way we perceive reality. For starters, we’ve seen the emergence of new psychological disorders like rapid onset gender dysphoria. Also, girls are giving themselves Tourette’s by watching videos on TikTok.

Even when we manage to tear our gaze away from the screen for a while, it haunts us. Hiking in New Hampshire this autumn, I was amazed by how many cars there were from Massachusetts and New York. Most of the “hikers” were women in their late 20s and a full face of makeup, boyfriends in tow. When we reached the bluff, my wife and I stood back and watched as they spent ten or 20 minutes posing for endless photos. As Thoreau said, “From the desperate city you go into the desperate country…”

And, of course, our news is fake. All news is fake news. I don’t have to explain that one, do I?

We have no idea just how much control Big Tech has over our lives. We desire what they tell us to desire. We believe what they tell us to believe. We buy what they tell us to buy. We’ve sold ourselves into virtual slavery. And if anyone (like Thoreau) urges us to seize our freedom, we call him a hipster and laugh him off.

But as a great presidential Thoreauvian once said,

It is not the critic who counts; not the man who points out how the strong man stumbles, or where the doer of deeds could have done them better. The credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena… who at the best knows in the end the triumph of high achievement, and who at the worst, if he fails, at least fails while daring greatly, so that his place shall never be with those cold and timid souls who neither know victory nor defeat.

If Thoreau failed, he failed while daring greatly. And it’s the daring that we hate him for. Deep down, there’s a part of us—all of us—that longs to be free, as Thoreau longed to be free. We want to live deliberately. We crave authenticity. As we should! But, like Theodore said, that means we have to do something.

Start by falling in love with the world. Let yourself be swept away by the romance of reality.

Living authentically doesn’t mean growing a big, bushy beard. It could mean growing a little tomato. Plant yourself in the soil, if it’s only a little pot on the windowsill.

Spend at least an hour outside every day. Look at things. Listen to things. Smell things. If you can’t go outside, clean the bathroom or do the dishes without listening to music or podcasts. Be alone with your thoughts.

Get rid of your smartphone and get a flip-phone. This is the best decision you’ll ever make in your entire life. You’ll look back in ten years and wish you’d done it ten years sooner.

Download one of the many apps and extensions that let you limit your time on the computer. I use Cold Turkey and couldn’t recommend it more highly.

Read at least one book every fortnight. It’s easier than it sounds. As a wise man once said, the secret to reading more is simple: spend more time reading. Yet another reason to cut back on your screen time.

Get together with people in real life. Set rules for yourselves: no phones for an hour, two hours, however long you’re together. Make eye contact. Smile. Laugh together. The first ten minutes will be painful, but power through it. If you’ve been looking and hearing and thinking and reading, it will be much easier.

If neither of you have anything to say, be at ease in the silence. The most unnatural thing about the modern world is the total lack of quiet. We fill the world with meaningless sounds to avoid being alone with ourselves. St. Augustine spoke of those who “live for their bodies and their blather.” I think he meant us.

Do real work, even if it’s menial. Rake your leaves instead of using a leaf-blower. Cut up a tree with an axe instead of a chainsaw. When your friend asks for help moving furniture, go for it.

Get a hobby. Learn an instrument. Collect stamps. Write letters. Whittle. Box. Whatever floats your boat. Actually, boating is a good one, too.

Shop at local stores, farmers markets, etc. If you can’t find it within a 20-mile radius, you probably don’t need it. (Of course, books don’t count.)

If you’re a boy, find a nice girl. If you’re a girl, find a nice boy. Don’t mess around until you’re married, but don’t waste time with a long courtship, either. Have lots of kids. Take them camping and hiking and hunting and fishing. Life is an adventure. Share it with your family.

Go for walks. As Thoreau said, “We should go forth on the shortest walk, perchance, in the spirit of undying adventure, never to return,—prepared to send back our embalmed hearts only as relics to our desolate kingdoms.” Anyone who’s tempted to snigger has never been on a real walk.

It’ll be hard. You’re addicted to the illusions, and addictions are always hard to break. Still, I think you’ll agree, it’s worth being disillusioned.

Last time, in Part One of this two-part series, we talked about the Lefty group Never Again Action (NAA), an anti-ICE protest organization that’s heavily community-specific: It’s all about onramps to recruit and radicalize progressive American Jews. Because it’s oriented toward newbies, they’ve been pretty open with their toolkits and about how their protests work.

To recap: An NAA action is designed and carried out by (volunteer) members of a local chapter of NAA, under the guidance of a (paid) professional organizer who works for the national organization. NAA calls its professional organizers “coaches.” Their action-planning divides into five stages: Preparation, Escalation, Execution and Amplification, Debrief, and Absorb—i.e., not just the action itself, but the stages before and after.

Last time, we covered the first stage, in which the local chapter chooses a coordinator and department leads: tactical, digital, and comms. The leads and the coach decide on their goal and work backwards from there to identify the path the action will take and what those steps require in terms of resources and personnel.

The second stage, Escalation, is where people really start getting staffed into the action structure’s departments: Comms/Digital, Tactical, Logistics, and People Support. (Remember, this structure is flexible, and people in it may have multiple roles).

In the lead-up to the action, Comms/Digital requires a lead, writers of press releases and scripts, someone to handle advance outreach to press, and a coach for the spokespeople, whose job will be to train spokespeople as they are brought on. On the day of, there’s a lot of emphasis on the infrastructure for getting the story out: lead comms, the spokesperson coach, people doing social media, someone to do the livestream (and someone to support the person doing the livestream), photographers, spokespeople, emcees for the event, speakers, a support person for the speakers, song leaders if the event has singing (NAA events frequently do)—that sort of thing.

Tactical roles are about what you’d expect. They’re in charge of the execution of the direct action, including any rowdiness. There’s a tactical lead and a second tactical lead. There are a couple of scouts. There’s a lead marshal and a marshal for every 20 people, based on an ahead-of-time estimate of the crowd size. The marshals’ job is to keep people from doing anything stupid like, for example, redirecting the march or escalating beyond what was agreed on. There are police liaisons and legal observers, the latter often free courtesy of the National Lawyers’ Guild.

Logistics is the department responsible for all the stuff necessary to make the rest happen. There’s a logistics head and a host of subsidiary roles: materials, driver coordination, support vehicle drivers, and jail support. The materials person is in charge of getting, well, materials—if you need supplies to build those giant puppets Lefties love, they’re the ones to buy them. Driver coordination is the head of transportation, supervising the necessary number of support vehicle drivers. There’s also jail support, with a lead and a number of jail support staff. The job of jail support is to help people who get arrested. Whether or not people will be arrested depends a lot on choices the police make, but some protestors (termed “red team”) may deliberately do things that increase or make certain the chances of arrest. (An action that carries a heightened level of conflict that may lead to arrests is termed a “red action.”)

Jail support is worth a digression, because it’s something that Righties completely lack familiarity with and it’s tremendously important to the Lefty protest scene. Most of it is just practical stuff: knowing where the various jails are located, what their routines are, and what the usual procedure is for getting people out of them. If you’ve ever seen a picture of a protestor with a phone number written on their arm in marker, that’s the support number they call in the event that they’ve been arrested.

Sometimes jail support has money to bail people out, or legal support to hook people up with. Sometimes all they can do is just let friends and family know someone has been arrested. But one small thing jail support does can be tremendously important: just being at the jail and providing a favorite snack or cold soft drink to people who’ve just been released. It sounds silly, but it shows meaningful support and helps with bonding—that’s why Hard Lefties do it.

And yes, they ask people for their favorite snack or drink in advance: Each person risking arrest fills out a jail support form ahead of time. These include personal identifying information necessary for finding someone in the system and getting them out, emergency contact information, and whether emergency contact should be notified immediately upon the arrest or not. The forms ask for any relevant health or legal information, where to transport the person to after release, and (if they’re from out of town), if they need to be out by a specific time to catch their transport home. They give you an overview of what to expect if you’re arrested, how to deal with police (i.e., “shut up”), and to not say anything sensitive in social media or on a jail phone call.

This is a lot of groundwork, but it can be tremendously helpful; even if the organizers aren’t in a position to get people out of jail, knowing what to expect from the experience and having some kind of support through it makes being arrested with friends less demoralizing than being arrested alone.

The last department is people support; this is accessibility stuff, medics (these are useful on scene if you’re getting pepper-sprayed, or if God forbid somebody gets really hurt), and people hosting and facilitating “healing space,” i.e., where people meet to discuss the action.

By the way, just a reminder: the action hasn’t started yet.

Everything discussed up till now has been preparation. Now the organizers have their plan, they have their structure staffed out (again, one person may have multiple roles, and this isn’t about hierarchy so much as just making sure stuff gets done). They know what they’re doing, and they conduct trainings to make sure everybody is on the same page and knows what to do. Now it’s time for stage three: Execution and Amplification. That is, do the action, and tell the story. If the story isn’t told, the action doesn’t matter; that’s why NAA puts so much focus on media outreach.

On the morning of the action, there’s a huddle for the key leads, including people risking arrest, a short walk away from the action. There’s no invocation, but there is a spiritual quality deliberately employed to ground it. People introduce themselves; the coordinator recaps their goals, what metrics they’re using to determine success, and reviews the agreed principles of the organization and the action. Following this, the coordinator reviews the schedule beat by beat, lays out potential scenarios that are planned for, and reviews the plans for exit and how the group will claim victory afterwards. Key leads of various departments introduce themselves. Everyone is put on the same page about who makes decisions in particular circumstances, and how communications will be handled. The meeting concludes with a song or a trust exercise, and then everybody walks to the action place, does the action, and tells the story of it.

After the action comes stage four, the Debrief, in which people learn and process their experience, particularly those who took escalated risk. NAA red teams (the people who do things more likely to result in arrest) actually have a quasi-religious ceremony for this. Finally, stage five: Absorb. In other words: take the lessons learned from the action and use them to inform your actions in the future. You know, that thing we Righties never, ever do, unless the lesson we decide to learn is “we should never do this stuff because it is scary and hard,” rather than things like: “Maybe I shouldn’t go to events organized by people who mysteriously consistently manage to avoid legal entanglements they really should have suffered—or, if I do, I should be very careful of the fast friends I make there.”

The Lefties absorb, then they take what they learned, design another action, and do it again.

Don’t take my word for it. Here are a couple hundred pages worth of NAA’s toolkits and references, including a couple of references from other organizations. Names, locations, and contact information are redacted, because this column isn’t about making news or singling out individuals but about helping readers understand the history, methods, and mechanics of organizing. Go page through NAA’s onboarding manuals, and appreciate the fact that this is what giving your people help looks like. Whatever your cause is, wouldn’t you like something this detailed and helpful on a meaningful action for the cause you care about?

Now take a moment to remember what the structure enabling all this looks like: paid organizers working for the national organization helping out volunteer-run local chapters.

Righties like to get hot under the collar about paid protestors, but that’s just not how it works. Paying protestors to turn out would get expensive. But organizing is more about skills than money. Setting up nonprofits that pay the people to create and run the events is actually pretty cost-effective. Even when there’s big money funding it, organizing is not usually lucrative. Lefty organizers can do all right running an organization, but most get paid at best a modest living.

Never Again Action actually tweeted out their budgets for the last three months of 2019 and all of 2020. According to these, they had 11 organizers and in the last three months of 2019 were paying them very modestly—only around $2,000 per month. They spent $54,000 on national and distributed actions, with about half of that being travel.

2019:

2020 saw some changes, due in large part to the pandemic:

Never Again Action upped everyone’s salaries to a total of $404,606.73 for 11 organizers—this is more than fair considering how poorly they were paid before—and cut the budget for actions for Covid reasons. They also put actions, leadership development, and planning retreats under the same line item, which is probably a lot more fun than if they’re separate line items. The last quarter of 2019 had a total budget of $140,793.00; if you quadruple that, you get an estimated annual budget of $642K for the level of activity they produced in the last three months of 2019. The total 2020 budget was $537,176.73.

These figures are a lot of money from the perspective of a normal working person. But just for comparison, a few years ago the budget of Turning Point USA was approximately $8.3 million. That’s mostly salaries, conferences, and speaking engagements, in contrast to NAA’s cheaper actions. Which organization made more news and directly impacted the narrative? Which one was more successful at steering their side of the aisle? You could triple Never Again Action’s budget for salaries and actions, create three additional organizations just like it, and you would still be coming in cheaper than one year of TPUSA.

Or, put another way: What could our well-funded conservative organizations and our deep-pocketed donors do to help people do in their own towns, if they put their minds to it?

If by any chance that’s you, consider helping out your local activists. It’s easy to write a check to somebody famous, or a politician with a slick ad in a hopeless district. But if you spend money on local grassroots work, you can get a lot more bang for your buck, impact the conversation, and just might help build a stronger community on your side of the aisle where you live.

With 14 celebrities all saying the same three words, repeatedly, along with sustained eye-contact, it was more akin to a failed attempt at hypnosis than an argument. Although the reception was mixed, even among those who share the BLM agenda, critics didn’t ask the basic question of why it is that celebrities advocate on social justice issues at all.

Such advocating is now so commonplace it goes largely unnoticed. Last month, Mitt Romney praised Paris Hilton for her work on raising the issue of the Troubled Teen Industry, sharing gratitude that she is now advocating at the federal level. Paris Hilton is a prime example of someone “famous for being famous,” going from It-girl to superstar after a homemade sex tape was leaked in 2003.

Ricky Gervais came close to questioning celebrity advocacy when his Oscar’s Speech of 2020 berated the assembled stars for being “in no position to lecture the public about anything” as they “know nothing about the real world.” What he failed to mention, however, was the public relations industry which drives celebrities to advocate on woke causes in the first place.

While woke capitalism is highly visible, woke P.R. goes below the radar. P.R., of course, is always in the shadowy space between product and consumer. Behind all the faux-sincerity of those celebrities clutching their pearls and gazing into the camera to say “I take responsibility,” there is the army of publicists and consultants out of frame—calculating how best to maximize reputational advantage from whichever social justice fad is in vogue (and in Vogue).

Is there more going on than just this pragmatic manipulation of the status quo?

Some will retort immediately that different political ideologies and P.R. synchronize at different times. This is to play the classically liberal card of “neutrality of form.” Publicity is a necessary but inherently neutral feature of a world with mass communications, they say. Whether or not it engages with content that is highly questionable merely reflects decisions made by individuals working in that field. This is as far as Ricky Gervais got, berating the lack of ethical compass but not asking if genuinely moral orientation is even possible in a world that cherishes fame: “If ISIS started a streaming service, you’d call your agent, wouldn’t you?”

It could be that public relations and wokeness are partly reflective of a general cultural entropy, to which celebrity publicity is acutely vulnerable as the most vacuous pseudo-culture. That is, people don’t ask whether advocacy is the best route forward, but are carried downstream by the current of making everything advocacy without even noticing it.

But even that doesn’t do it justice. Allied with the entropy is a powerful force that accelerates in direct proportion with the deceleration of culture: technology. Why is woke posturing so seductive for P.R. agencies that it is becoming their raison d’être? Because there is a shared direction of travel between technological advancement, P.R., and identity politics. A shared telos, if you will.

Public relations was originally called “propaganda” for a reason. Edward Bernays, a founder of the industry, invented the term “public relations” because “propaganda got to be a bad word” after it was used during the First World War. He also coined an equally ubiquitous phrase to describe what P.R. does: the “engineering of consent.”

Mike Mercer writes that a partnership was formed “between Hollywood and the government” with the creation of the Committee of Public Information in 1916, for then it was recognized that “an entertainment product became a valuable tool of influence.” Mercer considers this the “critical point between the creation of culture as a sort of unconscious byproduct in the quest for profits and the deliberate product of ideas aimed at shaping the public’s mind.”

The problem with woke P.R., though, is not so much its being a product of deliberation, but its reaching a level of ubiquity whereby it is rarely questioned. It has become the unconscious byproduct itself. The range of things for which consent is engineered has markedly narrowed around identity politics.

David Miller and William Dinan note that Bernays’s work for Big Tobacco in the late 1920s led to a campaign to break the taboo against women smoking in public. What is salient here is how he did it: using political narratives of freedom and oppression. Hot on the heels of the suffragette movement earlier that decade, it was presented as a matter of sexual equality for women to smoke without shame, and he organized a parade down Fifth Avenue on Easter Sunday, 1929, of ten debutantes (provided by a contact at Vogue), with their lit cigarettes renamed “Torches of Freedom.”

Those claiming “neutrality of form” for communications techniques will say this was just dubious ethical decision making on Bernays’s part. Yet there are numerous times when early P.R. moguls presented their trade as something that could re-form society itself, something with substantial content of its own. Bernays’s mentor, Walter Lippmann, wrote in The Phantom Public that P.R. could neutralize situations that threaten to turn into social unrest. The industry could manipulate opinion to protect the elite from the demands of the people. This approach was developed following the sociologist Gabriel Tarde, who had distinguished between the “crowd” and the “public.” Crowds insistently and threateningly make demands, he wrote, but unruly crowds would be replaced by what he called “the public.” Technology enabled interaction between people who are not physically present at the same space and time. Tarde thus spoke of modern society as promising a public—meaning “a dispersion of individuals who are physically separated and whose cohesion is entirely mental” and which could be “extended indefinitely.”

Seeking a cohesion that is “entirely mental” means there is also a close proximity between P.R. and techniques of psychological manipulation. Another early innovator, Ivy Ledbetter Lee, said “publicity is a matter of mass psychology.” Psychology itself was a burgeoning science in the early 20th century, along with the technology of mass communications, both of which joined with P.R. to create a three-headed hydra. Bernays himself was a nephew of Sigmund Freud, and the great-uncle of the founder of Netflix.

In the U.K., this threefold alliance has reached the point where the government response to the Covid-19 pandemic was to have nudge theorists from the government’s behavioral psychology unit orchestrating not just the publicity about lockdowns, but also the “test and trace” apps that came with it. The gravitational pull toward physical separation and a new cohesion which is “entirely mental” has intensified in ways even Lippman, Lee, and Bernays dared not to dream.

The cult of celebrity can be situated right in the center of PR’s genesis. Theorists mostly agree with Chris Rojek, who wrote in Fame Attack that “the development of public relations” and the “underpinning philosophy” of Bernays “lies at the centre of the celebrity industry.” The role of technology in this, however, gets less attention.

Daniel Boorstin’s The Image focused on the quantity of visual reproduction technology brought to someone like, say, Marilyn Monroe, so that encounters with images become “human pseudo-events” in peoples’ lives. This idea was developed later by Richard Schickel, who understands celebrities as creating an “illusion of intimacy” with their consumers. The drive toward physical separation thus intensifies in celebrity adulation. Now the public could include a pseudo-family, also entirely mental. The way this leads into pornography is self-evident. Vast numbers of Lippman’s phantom public now have sexual encounters with phantoms on a daily basis.

Perhaps the most influential consideration of the celebrity phenomenon is Richard Dyer’s Stars from 1979. This is considered groundbreaking in its interpretation of celebrities as “signs”: nodes of competing social influences, showing people how the various pushes and pulls of social life can be integrated in a particular personality. Those who idolize a celebrity thus identify with how that individual’s image promises to blend different influences in a meaningful whole. P. David Marshall built on Dyer’s work to argue that “celebrities represent subject positions that the audience adopt or adapt in their formation of social identities,” for the celebrity is “an embodiment of a discursive battleground on the norms of individuality and personality within a culture.”

Here we come to the decisive development. There is no real “discursive battleground” anymore, for the range of social identities on offer has so greatly reduced. In the 1980s, a young man could identify with Bruce Springsteen, or Michael Jackson, or Hulk Hogan, or Chuck D. In the 2020s celebrity identities don’t have differing ideological underpinnings (Springsteen, working-class patriotism; Michael Jackson, eccentric humanitarianism; Hulk Hogan, nationalism; Chuck D, black power). There is one ideological underpinning. Celebrities have gone from being the site of a discursive battleground to being the victor’s spoils.

Why would P.R. be complicit in this ideological narrowing? Because one particular identity offers a never-ending cascade of sub-identities, forever splintering and fracturing into different permutations of the oppressed categories of identity politics. Lippman wanted a public realm that could be “extended indefinitely,” and identity politics provides it.

Moreover, technology is entirely complicit in this because internet data work in such a way as to inhibit scrutiny of ideological priors. Viktor Mayer-Schönberger observes that a Big Data society is one where people don’t “know why but what.” Data can only tell agencies what people are doing, and nothing about motivation or cause—about intention. But questions about how people should actually live are about intention, requiring a range of options pushed out of sight by aggregated statistics. As Christopher Caldwell notes, “the internet approach to data, and to reality, undermined all types of thinking aimed at understanding systems from the outside.” The outside is harder than ever to glimpse. We are all in the Matrix now.

TAC’s Helen Andrews rightly observes that “the boomer’s embrace of mass culture has been the death of both folk culture and high culture.” Much critique of the celebrity world tends to critique popular culture as folk culture, not realizing that celebrity itself is a targeted attack on the common life of people. This assault on common life takes two steps. Firstly, genuine physical presence and interaction must be minimized or at least made secondary, so there are fewer common spaces. Secondly, the phantoms presented to the public must no longer be genuinely and substantially connected with differing orientations for ordering life itself. The result is a commons not held in common by persons as ends-in-themselves, but a phantasmagoria of illusory meaning—an infinite regress of eternal advocacy within the same narrow set of priors.

In 2006, Kay S. Hymowitz described Americans as having “less of a common culture, but we all still share Paris Hilton.” This sharing is the pseudo-sharing by a phantom public of one who gained notoriety precisely because a sex tape found its way onto the internet at exactly the moment in 2003 when broadbrand enabled the viewing of such video footage to spread like never before. “It-girl” is an instructive term, for persons as micro-components aggregated in the digital swarm are indeed each made a mere “it,” a mere object.

Findings from the New York State Assembly’s impeachment investigation of Andrew Cuomo released Monday revealed a string of abuses of power by the former governor, including sexual harassment, the use of staff to write his book, and a cover-up of COVID-19 nursing home deaths.

The eight-month probe found “overwhelming evidence that the former governor engaged in sexual harassment,” according to the 46-page report. The report focused on two of the at least 11 women who have accused Cuomo of sexual assault: an unidentified state trooper and Brittany Commisso, who served as an executive assistant to Cuomo and has accused him of groping her. Commisso’s allegations resulted in a criminal complaint against Cuomo.

The Assembly Judiciary Committee found that the now-disgraced former governor likely violated state ethics laws as he “utilized the time of multiple state employees, as well as his own, to further his personal gain during a global pandemic” in writing and promoting his memoir, American Crisis: Leadership Lessons from the Covid-19 Pandemic.

The finding contrasts Cuomo’s claims that work on his book was undertaken on a volunteer basis. The investigation found that the work was completed during regular work hours “as part of the regular course of work in the executive chamber.” A senior state official complained to a coworker that time spent on the book had taken away from that official’s ability to focus on the COVID-19 pandemic, the report found.

The report adds that Cuomo was “not fully transparent regarding the number of nursing home residents who died as a result of COVID-19.”

The law firm that conducted the inquiry on the Assembly’s behalf did not interview Cuomo, though he has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing. The report noted that the investigation had considered Cuomo’s rebuttals and concluded that “nothing in his voluminous submissions can overcome the overwhelming evidence of his misconduct.”

The Assembly report follows an investigation by New York state attorney general Letitia James earlier this year that found that the governor sexually harassed almost a dozen women in violation of federal and state law. James’ office also found that COVID-19 deaths in nursing homes had been significantly undercounted; officials ultimately raised the count by more than 40 percent.

The Assembly inquiry — which included the review of emails, text messages, BlackBerry PIN messages, photos, phone calls, video recordings, deposition transcripts and interview memos — was launched in March as an impeachment investigation after Cuomo had become embroiled in multiple scandals but the former governor later resigned in August one week after James released her report.

Though Cuomo has resigned, some state lawmakers are calling for the Democrat to be impeached in order to prohibit him from running for public office again in the future.

Continuing the wave of withdrawals, Mississippi and Illinois are the latest state school board groups to cancel their membership with the National School Board Association over its letter to the Biden administration requesting federal investigation of parents who protest at school-board meetings.

Most of the alienated state chapters have expressed the same grievances as their reasoning for departure. They have slammed the NSBA’s decision to send the letter, prompting Attorney General Merrick Garland to deploy the FBI and federal law enforcement to investigate and potentially prosecute parents who “threaten” school administrators, as an encroachment on their local affairs.

Mississipi’s group, one of the many who were not consulted by the NSBA before the letter was issued to President Biden, was no exception. In a decision voted on Monday, the MSBA Board of Directors severed its relationship with the headquarters, adding that it does not see “the value of continued membership,” according to Mississippi Today.

“The September 29 letter from NSBA to President Biden, with the inflammatory language and the request for federal agencies to intervene in our communities, was just one in a series of lapses in governance,” MSBA President Leroy Matthews and Executive Director Denotris Jackson wrote in an email to school board presidents and superintendents.

On Thursday, Illinois voted to end its affiliation with the NSBA, citing “repeated attempts” to ensure its representation and the recognition of its interests at the national level, which ultimately were not fulfilled.

“This decision follows repeated attempts by representatives of IASB and other state associations to bring about changes in governance, transparency and government oversight necessary to ensure the viability of the national organization and IASB’s membership in it,” the chapter wrote in its exit statement.

Now including Mississippi and Illinois, 14 state groups have cut ties with and 26 have distanced themselves from the national organization after the letter, according to a database compiled by nonprofit Parents Defending Education.

CDC director Dr. Rochelle Walensky on Friday signed off on an advisory panel’s recommendation to expand eligibility for COVID-19 vaccine booster shots to all American adults age 18.

Walensky’s endorsement, which was the final step in allowing all American adults to receive the boosters, came after a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention advisory panel voted 11–0 on Friday in favor of expanding eligibility.

The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) unanimously decided to recommend that all adults be made eligible for a booster shot and that every adult age 50 and over receive a booster. The vote came after the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) earlier in the day approved requests by Moderna and Pfizer to allow all adults to receive their booster shots.

In September, an advisory panel to the Food and Drug Administration recommended against approving a booster shot of the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine to most Americans. At the time, the scientific advisory committee voted 16–3 against recommending the additional shots for all adults, after the Biden administration had already begun to herald the forthcoming boosters.

The panel did, however, vote 18–0 in favor of recommending a booster shot for anyone over 65, or anyone who is at high risk of severe disease from COVID-19, and boosters have already been endorsed for those groups by the CDC.

Boosters are also already recommended for people who received the single-dose Johnson & Johnson vaccine at least two months ago.

Members of ACIP had previously expressed concern that there was not sufficient evidence that boosters are needed for all adults. However, a Pfizer study found that a booster could increase protection against symptomatic infection to about 95 percent.

President Biden announced a new plan to combat the coronavirus pandemic heading into the winter, including stricter testing requirements for international travel.

“I’m announcing today that all inbound international travelers must test within one day of departure, regardless of their vaccination status or nationality,” Biden said in a speech at the National Institutes of Health. “And we are extending the requirement, both internationally and domestically, to wear masks for travel on aircraft, trains, public transportation through the winter months.”

Biden said his administration will require insurers to cover the costs of at-home coronavirus tests, in order to expand their availability. Biden also reiterated that the Food and Drug Administration and Centers for Disease Control are recommending booster shots for Americans who already received a COVID-19 vaccine.

“More than about 100 million are eligible for boosters but haven’t gotten the booster shot yet. Folks, if you’re over the age of 18, and you got vaccinated before June 2, six months has gone by—go get your booster shot now,” Biden said.

The Biden administration will also encourage school districts to remain open for in-person learning throughout the winter, after many districts struggled to reopen during the 2020-2021 academic year. The administration is calling on states to mandate COVID-19 vaccinations for all school employees, and Biden has directed the CDC and Department of Health and Human Services to assist districts in testing students and staff for coronavirus.

The president’s announcement came following the discovery of the Omicron variant of coronavirus its detection in the U.S. Health officials are currently studying whether the variant could partially evade immunity provided by coronavirus vaccines, with NIH director Francis Collins telling Fox News Sunday it could “take two, three weeks in both laboratory and field studies” to know for certain.

White House chief medical adviser Anthony Fauci acknowledged on Sunday that travel restrictions cannot completely stop the spread of a new coronavirus variant, dubbed “Omicron,” into the U.S.

Dr. Anthony Fauci acknowledges there’s “no way” travel bans would completely prevent COVID-19 variants from entering the country, but tells @GStephanopoulos that the policies ""delay it enough to get us better prepared."" https://t.co/G7DDQ1ZhuC pic.twitter.com/gTQrrXr6m2 — This Week (@ThisWeekABC) November 28, 2021

“Travel bans, when you have a highly transmissible virus, never completely would…prevent it from coming into the country. No way that’s going to happen,” Fauci told host George Stephanopoulos on ABC’s This Week. “What you can do is, you can delay it enough to get us better prepared.”

Fauci called for “utiliz[ing] the time” afforded by a travel ban to research the new variant and get more people vaccinated. The Biden administration imposed bans on travel from eight southern African nations, exempting American citizens and legal permanent residents, after the Omicron variant was detected in those countries.

The new variant has over 30 mutations to the virus’s spike protein, which project from the virus’s surface, and has caused fears that the variant could partially evade immunity provided by coronavirus vaccines.

“It does make you worry that it’s a sufficiently different virus that it might not respond as well to protection from the vaccines. But we don’t know that,” National Institutes of Health director Francis Collins said on Fox News Sunday. Collins cautioned that it will “take two, three weeks in both laboratory and field studies” to see whether the mutations allow the variant to “evade protection.”

Former Food and Drug Administration commissioner Scott Gottlieb said vaccine developers are “fairly confident” that people vaccinated with booster shots should be protected from the Omicron variant.

“If you talk to people in vaccine circles, people who are working on a vaccine, they have a pretty good degree of confidence that a boosted vaccine, so three full doses of vaccine, is going to be fairly protective against this new variant,” Gottlieb told host Margaret Brennan on CBS’s Face the Nation.

Treasury secretary Janet Yellen blamed the COVID-19 pandemic for the record inflation increase the U.S. is seeing and said the country must continue to “make progress” against the pandemic to get inflation under control.

CBS’s Face the Nation host Margaret Brennan asked Yellen in a pre-taped interview aired on Sunday if she is confident the price of consumer goods will return to normal levels by next November.

The Treasury secretary replied that it “really depends on the pandemic.”

“The pandemic has been calling the shots for the economy and for inflation. And if we want to get inflation down, I think continuing to make progress against the pandemic is the most important thing we can do. I think it’s — it’s — it’s important to realize that the cause of this inflation is the pandemic,” Yellen said.

Yellen’s comments come after the Labor Department released a report last week showing that inflation had reached a 31-year high.

She said the pandemic caused the spike in inflation because it “all but shut down our economy” and “led to a dramatic increase in demand for products.”

“The pandemic is really responsible, in its impact, for the inflation that we’re seeing,” she said.

“Households were unable to spend on services — going out to eat and traveling. They shifted as they stayed at home, worked more from home. They shifted their spending on to goods that led to a surge in the demand for products. And although the supply of products has increased in the United States and globally, not as much as demand,” Yellen added.

She predicted that prices could return to normal levels sometime in the second half of next year if the U.S. is “successful with the pandemic.”

Meanwhile, National Economic Council director Brian Deese said on Sunday that he and President Biden were not wrong months ago when they downplayed inflation as a short-term issue caused by the pandemic.

CNN’s Jake Tapper asked Deese if he and Biden were wrong in saying that inflation is a “short-term ‘pop up a little bit and then go back down’ issue,” especially after Biden finally acknowledged this week that inflation is “worrisome.”

“No, I don’t think so, Jake,” Deese replied. “I think what we have said consistently is that the pandemic and the economy are interlinked and certainly we saw just as the Delta variant posed real health challenges to the economy it also had economic impacts.”

Pfizer and BioNTech will request authorization from the Biden administration to expand eligibility for their COVID-19 booster shots to the general population, multiple outlets reported on Tuesday.

The request could be filed as soon as this week, sources told the New York Times and Washington Post. Both papers reported that the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is likely to grant the request, although it wasn’t immediately clear exactly how soon the approval process would be completed.

Pfizer spokesman Kit Longley declined to comment on the development when asked by the Post.

A key FDA advisory panel voted against authorizing booster shots for the general population in September, opting instead to recommend boosters for Americans over the age of 65, or otherwise at increased risk from COVID-19. That recommendation came after President Biden announced his administration would make booster shots of both the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines available to most Americans.

Since then, the FDA and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have authorized booster shots for all three coronavirus vaccines in use in the U.S. — including Johnson & Johnson’s — for at-risk Americans. Recipients are also permitted to receive a booster shot made by a different company than their initial vaccine.

Almost 25 million Americans have received a booster shot since they became available, according to data from the CDC on Tuesday. Close to 80 percent of Americans over the age of 12 have received at least one dose of a coronavirus vaccine, including 98.3 percent of Americans over 65.

A key Food and Drug Administration advisory panel has recommended approving Merck’s antiviral COVID-19 pill for at-risk adults, paving the way for potential emergency authorization by the end of this year.

The Antimicrobial Drugs Advisory Committee voted 13-10 to recommend authorization of the pill, known as molnupiravir. Merck found in clinical trials that the pill reduced the chance of hospitalization and death in at-risk COVID-19 patients by 30 percent.

The FDA could authorize molnupiravir within days for at-risk Americans, i.e. the elderly and other adults with co-morbidities for COVID-19.

Additionally, the FDA may authorize a similar pill from Pfizer in the coming weeks, which that company found to reduce risk of hospitalization and death by 89-percent in at-risk patients.

The news comes after the discovery of the Omicron coronavirus variant, with over 30 mutations to the virus’s spike protein, which allows the virus to attach to human cells. The high number of mutations has led to speculation that the variant could more easily evade immunity provided by available coronavirus vaccines.

“I think it’s going to be a material drop” in immunity, Moderna CEO Stéphane Bancel told the Financial Times on Tuesday. “I just don’t know how much because we need to wait for the data.”

However, Merck’s antiviral pill targets the mechanism used by the coronavirus to replicate, meaning it could remain effective against new variants. Molnupiravir was tested against a number of existing coronavirus variants including Gamma and Delta.

“We expect, based on what we know about the Omicron variant, that molnupiravir would be effective against this particular variant,” Dr. Nicholas Kartsonis, senior vice president for clinical research at Merck, told the FDA panel on Tuesday.

The discovery of a new COVID variant in South Africa sent U.S. stock indexes plummeting on Friday, triggering financial-market uncertainty as well as travel and commercial restrictions in a number of nations in the continent and in Europe.

At the open of the market, the Dow Jones Industrial Average dipped nearly 835 points, or 2.3 percent, indicating a large sell-off in assets among traders responding to the development. The S&P 500 dropped 1.4 percent at the start of the day, while the Nasdaq Composite Index slumped 0.9 percent.

Amid fears that the new version of the virus could be more infectious and vaccine resistant than the Delta variant, which has defied the vaccine in terms of prevention in some cases, the World Health Organization conducted an emergency scientific review of the strain Friday.

At the meeting, the WHO classified the new variant as a highly transmissible virus of concern, naming it “Omicron.” The agency said that the first known confirmed case was from a sample collected on November 9.

Brent crude oil also took a hit, deceasing 5 percent to under $77 a barrel, a record dip since July. Cryptocurrency tumbled as well, with Bitcoin reaching below $55,000 after hovering around $60,000 for much of the last week.

Investors looking to evade risk piled into more stable securities such as Treasury bonds, the yields of which sunk in accordance with their inverse relationship with prices, as well as gold.

While financial markets had calmed to the COVID storm for many months, shifting its sensitivity to inflation worries, unfettered fiscal stimulus, and the national debt, Friday’s market downslide appears to be a preemptive reaction to an impending COVID wave.

Scientists seem to suggest that the new variant, called B. 1.1.529, has many mutations that could make it more transmissible and render the protective mechanism of the vaccine and natural immunity provided by previous infection less potent. The WHO will meet Friday to determine if it is a “variant of concern.”

Many scientists had already anticipated a winter wave of the disease, in which confirmed cases spike during the cold weather and holiday season, but the new variant may pose a unique challenge to economies and medical systems.

As the efficacy of summer vaccinations starts to wane, the United States and many other Western countries are pushing the booster shot to provide the immunocompromised and other vulnerable populations an added layer of health defense.

A federal appeals court temporarily blocked a COVID-19 vaccine mandate for California prison workers on Friday.

The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals granted a request for a stay of a lower court order from September pending an appeal, delaying the January 12 deadline to have thousands of prison workers submit proof of vaccination or a religious or medical exemption. The deadline will be pushed back until at least March, when the appeal hearing will be scheduled, according to the Associated Press.

The appeals court also moved the deadline for opening briefs up to December 13.

U.S. District Judge Jon Tiga ruled in September that prison employees would either have to get the vaccine or a medical or religious exemption to do work outside the prison, including as inmate firefighters, or to have in-prison visits from family.

However, Governor Gavin Newsom and the California Correctional Peace Officers Association have spoken out against the mandate. The CCPOA has warned that the mandate could create staff shortages if employees refuse to comply.

At least 240 prisoners have died from COVID-19 and more than 50,000 prisoners — more than half of the state prison population — have contracted the virus, data from the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation show.

Don Specter, director of the nonprofit Prison Law Office, said the stay “puts both the prison staff and the incarcerated population at greater risk of infection.”

New York governor Kathy Hochul (D.) on Friday declared a state of emergency to prepare for the COVID-19 Omicron variant.

The emergency order, which will be in place until at least January 15, is intended to increase hospital capacity in the state in the event that the winter season and the new variant bring a surge in cases.

The order will allow the state to use a “surge and flex system,” enabling the Department of Health to limit non-essential and non-urgent hospital procedures in situations where a hospital has less than 10 percent staffed bed capacity. The new policy takes effect on December 3.

“We’ve taken extraordinary action to prevent the spread of COVID-19 and combat this pandemic,” Hochul said in a statement. However, we continue to see warning signs of spikes this upcoming winter, and while the new Omicron variant has yet to be detected in New York State, it’s coming.”

“In preparation, I am announcing urgent steps today to expand hospital capacity and help ensure our hospital systems can tackle any challenges posed by the pandemic as we head into the winter months,” the Democratic governor added. “The vaccine remains one of our greatest weapons in fighting the pandemic, and I encourage every New Yorker to get vaccinated, and get the booster if you’re fully vaccinated.”

Hochul’s announcement came on the same day that President Biden imposed a travel ban on eight African countries beginning Monday in response to the Omicron variant. The strain has been detected in Botswana, Zimbabwe, Namibia, Lesotho, Eswatini, Mozambique, and Malawi. The ban followed an announcement by the World Health Organization that the variant has a “large number of mutation” some of which are “concerning.”

A majority of Americans — 72 percent — believe the COVID-19 pandemic originated with a lab leak in Wuhan, China and that the Chinese government then lied about it, a new poll found.

The poll, Ronald Reagan Institute’s 2021 National Defense Survey, also found that 42 percent of Americans believe it is “very likely” the pandemic stemmed from a Chinese lab leak.

Majorities from both parties agreed, with 86 percent of Republicans believing it is likely that COVID-19 leaked from a Wuhan lab and 61 percent of Democrats and 67 percent of independents in agreement, the poll shows.

Meanwhile, 76 percent of respondents said China should pay reparations to other nations as a penalty if it is determined that it did cover up a lab leak; 82 percent of Republicans and 72 percent of both Democrats and Independents agreed.

The survey comes after a declassified intelligence report revealed last month that the FBI concluded with “moderate confidence” that the pandemic began with a “laboratory accident” following a 90-day review ordered by President Biden earlier this year. The report did not name the single agency that supported the lab-leak theory, though the New York Times has identified that agency as the FBI.

A summary of the 17-page report released in August outlined intelligence agencies’ conclusions on the outbreak and revealed that the agencies were unable to determine whether the coronavirus jumped from an animal to a human or leaked from a lab.

The declassified report noted that four agencies within the intelligence community and the National Intelligence Council concluded with “low confidence” that the pandemic began with a jump from animal to human, rather than a lab leak. Several other agencies were not able to come to a conclusion.

Several virology labs are located in Wuhan, where the pandemic began, including the Wuhan Institute of Virology, where bat coronaviruses were studied. Peter Ben Embarek, the WHO food safety and animal diseases expert who led the organization’s investigation into the origins of the novel coronavirus, said in a documentary released in August that Chinese researchers in the group fought against connecting the origins of the pandemic to the Wuhan Institute of Virology in a report detailing the investigation.

“In the beginning, they didn’t want anything about the lab [in the report], because it was impossible, so there was no need to waste time on that,” Ben Embarek said. “We insisted on including it, because it was part of the whole issue about where the virus originated.”

The Biden administration is expected to announce stricter COVID-19 testing requirements for all travelers entering the U.S. on Thursday, including returning Americans, according to a new report.

Three federal health officials reportedly told the Washington Post the administration is readying stricter testing requirements amid concern over the new Omicron variant. The new guidance would require everyone entering the U.S. to be tested one day before boarding flights, regardless of vaccination status or country of departure.

Officials are also weighing a requirement that all travelers get retested within three to five days of arrival, as well as a proposal to require all travelers to self-quarantine for seven days, even if they test negative.

The requirements could be enforced by fines and penalties, according to the report.

While the two testing measures are included in a draft public health order written by the CDC that is currently under review by officials at the White House and the U.S. Health and Human Services Department, the self-quarantine requirements are not included in the draft. However, a self-quarantine measure could be added later, officials told the paper.

If the new rules take effect, they would mark a departure from the current guidance that requires only unvaccinated air travelers to be tested no more than one day before departure. Currently, those who show proof of full vaccination must be tested no more than three days before the flight’s departure.

The CDC said Tuesday it is working to require testing for all international air travelers one day before departure to the U.S. The agency already recommends that travelers test again three to five days after arrival and that unvaccinated travelers quarantine for a minimum of seven days.

CDC Director Rochelle Walensky said during a White House COVID briefing on Tuesday that the agency is weighing a number of measures to protect Americans from the new variant, including evaluating “how to make international travel as safe as possible, including pre-departure testing closer to the time of flight, and considerations around additional post-arrival testing and self-quarantines.”

It is possible the new policy could be implemented in a week or two, one official said.

The report comes after Biden on Friday imposed a travel ban on eight African countries in response to the omicron variant. The strain has been detected in Botswana, Zimbabwe, Namibia, Lesotho, Eswatini, Mozambique, and Malawi. The ban followed an announcement by the World Health Organization that the variant has a “large number of mutation” some of which are “concerning.”

Since the ban was put in place, omicron has been identified in some 19 countries worldwide. Meanwhile, little is known about the new variant.

Pfizer and BioNTech are expected to request approval from the Food and Drug Administration to administer COVID-19 booster shots to Americans ages 16 and 17, multiple outlets reported on Monday.

While booster shots for all coronavirus vaccines are authorized for anyone ages 18 and up, the FDA has authorized only the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine for Americans younger than 18. Pfizer and BioNTech will seek authorization for booster shots for 16- and 17-year-olds and they believe that regulators will approve the request quickly, according to the Washington Post.

The FDA authorized Pfizer and Moderna boosters for all adults in mid November. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention updated its recommendations for booster shots on Monday, saying that adult Americans “should” get a booster, when the agency previously said adults at lesser risk of COVID-19 “may” get one.

The news comes amid the emergence of the Omicron variant of coronavirus, which the World Health Organization classified as a variant “of concern.” Health officials in the U.S. have cautioned that it will take several weeks of research to determine whether the variant can evade protection offered by vaccines.

“I don’t think it is likely that there will be no protection from these vaccines against Omicron, but we may see waning of it,” Paul Burton, the chief medical officer at Moderna, told NBC on Monday.

The Occupational Safety and Health Administration has suspended implementation and enforcement of the Biden administration’s vaccine mandate for private employers after a federal court blocked the measure.

The OSHA website page dedicated to the COVID Vaccine Emergency Temporary Standard (ETS) reads: “While OSHA remains confident in its authority to protect workers in emergencies, OSHA has suspended activities related to the implementation and enforcement of the ETS pending future developments in the litigation.”

Last week, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit fully blocked Biden’s executive order requiring companies with over 100 workers to mandate vaccination for their employees after temporarily staying it on November 12. The court ordered that OSHA “take no steps to implement or enforce” the vaccine mandate “until further court order.”

By its mandate, the Biden administration is claiming that the federal government, through congressional legislation, has regulatory power to issue a medical mandate for the sake of public health and therefore general welfare.

However, since the directive was announced, many legal scholars have challenged its constitutionality, given that the legislation it relies on for authority explicitly states that an ETS can only be issued when employees are exposed to a “grave danger” that necessitates immediate action. That case is becoming increasingly difficult to argue, given the fact that some vaccinated individuals can transmit the disease and that treatment options for COVID infections are expanding. As of Tuesday, the Biden administration is planning to purchase 10 million doses of Pfizer’s antiviral medication to treat patents with COVID.

Some lawmakers and pundits have speculated that Biden’s strategy with the vaccine mandate recognized that the order would likely be indefensible in court but hoped that its chilling effect would pressure employers to comply in advance of any litigation.

After the federal appeals court first issued a motion to stay the order, White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki still urged employers to implement coercive measures to increase vaccination numbers among their labor forces, although without the teeth of government enforcement.

Miami-Dade County Public Schools, Florida’s largest school district, announced Tuesday that it would lift all mask mandates as COVID-19 conditions have “dramatically improved.”

The decision comes after a judge ruled last week that Governor Ron DeSantis had the authority to allow parents to opt-out of strict mandates. However, Miami-Dade superintendent Alberto Carvalho did not mention the ruling in his announcement, instead attributing the decision to falling COVID-19 cases and noting that the mandates could be reinstated if cases rise again.

“On the basis of current health conditions, which are dramatically improved, effective tomorrow parents can access the parent opt-out form from any elementary or K-8 school in Miami-Dade,” Carvalho said, according to the Associated Press.

Students who opt-out can stop wearing masks to school by Friday, the superintendent said at a news conference.

The decision comes after Carvalho lifted mask requirements for middle school and high school students earlier this month. At that time, he said he would allow elementary school students to opt-out as well if cases kept falling. Last week, three out of four schools in the district did not have any COVID-19 cases, Carvalho said.

Cases of COVID-19 in Florida have fallen from an average of 21,700 cases a day when the school year began in August to an average of 1,500 cases.

Broward County, Florida’s second-largest district, also made mask-wearing optional on Tuesday.

The shift brings both school districts in line with rules by the state’s health department that require districts to allow parents to decide whether their children wear masks. In July, DeSantis signed an executive order dictating that mask-wearing for children in public schools would be done at the discretion of parents. The state said it would withhold the salaries of administrators in districts that violated the directive.

The rule spent months in legal disputes and the Biden administration stepped in to offer compensation to at least one school district, Alachua County, that received fines over its mask mandate.

The Food and Drug Administration has authorized the Pfizer and Moderna COVID vaccine booster shots for Americans aged 18 and older.

On Thursday, the agency granted emergency use authorization for a third dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines to boost immune response in individuals who received the first two, the effectiveness of which have been shown to wane over time. The delta variant of the virus, a highly transmissible strain, partly prompted the rollout of the booster as it reduces the efficacy of the original vaccine in some individuals.

“The FDA has determined that the currently available data support expanding the eligibility of a single booster dose of the Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccines to individuals 18 years of age and older,” Peter Marks, M.D., Ph.D., director of the FDA’s Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research said. “Streamlining the eligibility criteria and making booster doses available to all individuals 18 years of age and older will also help to eliminate confusion about who may receive a booster dose and ensure booster doses are available to all who may need one.”

Qualified people are eligible to receive the booster six months after their second shot of either the Pfizer or Modern vaccine was administered, the FDA confirmed. For those who received the Johnson & Johnson vaccine, the booster is available to them two months after the single dose.

This development comes after the FDA already authorized the COVID vaccine for children aged five to eleven, making some 28 million children eligible to receive the third shot. Before that, the agency approved the boost shot for the elderly, Americans aged 65 and older as well as the immunocompromised.

White House chief medical adviser Anthony Fauci said Sunday that the U.S. will “hopefully” lift its travel ban on eight African countries “in a quite reasonable period of time” now that the COVID-19 Omicron variant has been detected in the U.S.

“As we’re getting more and more information about cases in our own country and worldwide we’re looking at that very carefully on a daily basis. Hopefully we’ll be able to lift that ban within a quite reasonable period of time,” Fauci said during an appearance on CNN’s State of the Union.

He added that the Biden administration is reassessing the policy, which applies to individuals departing from South Africa, Botswana, Zimbabwe, Mozambique, Malawi, Namibia, Lesotho, and Eswatini, “in real time, literally, on a daily basis.”

While World Health Organization director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus called it “deeply concerning” that African countries are being “penalized” for detecting and reporting the omicron variant, according to The Hill, Fauci defended the ban saying it was put in place when the U.S. was “really in the dark” on the new variant.

“We had no idea what was going on except that there seemed to have been an explosion of cases of Omicron in South Africa,” he said. “So when the ban was put on it was put to give us time to figure out just what is going on.”

Fauci added that officials felt “very badly” about the “hardship” the travel ban may have caused the countries affected by the ban.

The ban followed an announcement by the World Health Organization that the variant has a “large number of mutations” some of which are “concerning.”

Also on Sunday, Fauci hit back at accusations by Senator Ron Johnson (R., Wis.) that he is “overhyping” COVID-19.

“Over hyping Covid? It’s already killed 780,000 Americans and over 5 million people worldwide. So I don’t have any clue of what he’s talking about,” Fauci said.

U.S. Surgeon General Vivek Murthy said the Biden administration would defend its coronavirus vaccine mandate for employers with at least 100 workers, in an interview on ABC’s This Week on Sunday.

Surgeon General Dr. Vivek Murthy tells @MarthaRaddatz that the Biden administration is “prepared to defend” sweeping COVID-19 vaccine mandates against legal challenges, says new requirements are ""appropriate and necessary.” https://t.co/wBePNDjF7m pic.twitter.com/B3ZVCk6ODt — This Week (@ThisWeekABC) November 7, 2021

“The president and the administration wouldn’t have put these requirements in place if they didn’t think that they were appropriate and necessary, and the administration is certainly prepared to defend them,” Murthy told host Martha Raddatz.

Raddatz noted that some opponents of the mandate claim it could hurt the economy by leading to worker shortages, if employees refuse to get vaccinated.

“What I hear time and time again from small businesses, large businesses, and workers, is that what’s really hurting the economy is actually COVID itself,” Murthy responded. “Millions of workers have gotten sick because of COVID and predictably been pulled out of work. Millions more have had to be quarantined, and think about how disruptive that’s been to businesses.”

President Biden ordered the Labor Department’s Occupational Safety and Health Administration to develop a mandate for large employers on September 9. The outline of the mandate was released on Thursday, requiring companies to implement vaccine mandates by January 4th or face fines of $13,600 per violation. Unvaccinated employees would be permitted to work if they submit a weekly coronavirus test and wear a mask while on the job.

However, Murthy’s comments come one day after a three-judge panel on the Fifth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in New Orleans issued a temporary injunction against the mandate, citing “grave statutory and constitutional issues.”

The suit filed in the Fifth Circuit by states including Louisiana and Texas, businesses and religious groups, claims that such a mandate does not fall under the authority of OSHA.

“That is a quintessential legislative act — and one wholly unrelated to the purpose of OSHA itself, which is protecting workplace safety,” the suit states. “Nowhere in OSHA’s enabling legislation does Congress confer upon it the power to end pandemics.”

A federal judge blocked Texas Governor Greg Abbott‘s ban on mask mandates in public schools in a Wednesday ruling.

U.S. District Court Judge Lee Yeakel ruled that Abbott’s directive banning public schools from requiring students and faculty to wear masks as a condition of attendance infringed upon the right of disabled students to free and fair access to public education.

The nonprofit advocacy group Disabled Rights Texas filed the lawsuit against the state, contending that the order outlawed safeguards for health compromised children who are more susceptible to serious complications by COVID infection.

In his decision, Yeakel said: “The spread of COVID-19 poses an even greater risk for children with special health needs. Children with certain underlying conditions who contract COVID-19 are more likely to experience severe acute biological effects and to require admission to a hospital and the hospital’s intensive-care unit.”

Yeakel added that virus transmission in public schools remains high enough that it has prompted some districts to suspend in-person learning due to outbreaks among students and staff.

As a result of Yeakel’s ruling, Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, named as a defendant on the lawsuit in addition to Abbott, is barred from taking retaliatory action or imposing financial penalty, including withholding funding, on school districts who maintain mandatory mask protocols. As its next legal recourse, the state of Texas is considering seeking an appeal, Paxton’s office suggested in a tweet Wednesday.

“I strongly disagree with Judge Yeakel’s opinion barring my office from giving effect to GA-38, which prohibits mask mandates imposed by government entities like school districts,” Paxton wrote. “My Agency is considering all legal avenues to challenge this decision.”

A lawyer for the plaintiff lauded the ruling as a necessary protection for immunocompromised children.

“We are thankful that school districts can now take the steps necessary to protect these students,” Kym Davis Rogers, litigation attorney at Disability Rights Texas wrote in a statement. “No student should be forced to make the choice of forfeiting their education or risking their health, and now they won’t have to.”

Over the last few months, Abbott and Paxton have petitioned courts to strike down mask mandates in multiple localities across the state, such as Dallas County, which they argued enforced the measure in defiance of their earlier executive order.

Similar legal battles have played out in Florida over Republican Governor Ron DeSantis’s order prohibiting forced masking in public institutions.

Amid the discovery of the new highly infectious “Omicron” variant of the coronavirus, the Biden administration has imposed a travel ban on eight African countries.

The restrictions apply to South Africa, Botswana, Zimbabwe, Namibia, Lesotho, Eswatini, Mozambique, and Malawi, a senior administrative official told Politico. While the order excludes American citizens or lawful permanent residents, they will need to present proof of a negative COVID test before re-entering the United States.

The prohibition on travel to the U.S. from these nations begins Monday following the holiday weekend. The decision was prompted by the World Health Organization’s emergency meeting Friday, in which the agency classified the emerging virus as a highly transmissible strain. A statement from the meeting confirmed that the variant has many mutations that could render it potentially resistant to the current vaccine as well as natural immunity provided by prior infection.

On Friday, stock indices tumbled as financial markets reacted to the shock. The Dow Jones Industrial Average slumped over 800 points just minutes into the market’s open. Shifting from inflation fears and the supply chain crisis, investors responded to the impending economic risk of the new COVID variant by ditching equities for “safe haven” assets as fixed income and gold.

Amid the spike in COVID cases in the San Francisco Bay Area, Santa Cruz County has imposed a sweeping indoor mask mandate for private settings including homes.

For those gathering with people who don’t live in the same household, masks should be worn inside regardless of vaccination status, the county announced Monday. The guidelines also apply to businesses, with exceptions for eating and drinking.

Santa Cruz County was the first in California to drop its indoor mask mandate but is reinstating it as COVID cases rise.

“Unfortunately, a potential winter surge appears to be a significant threat to the health and safety of our community,” Dr. Gail Newel, Santa Cruz County’s health officer, said in a press release. Newel said the guidance is to protect vulnerable friends and family members from the disease.

As its enforcement mechanism, the county is demanding that businesses and governmental entities require their staff to wear masks as well as display instructional signs about masking-wearing at storefronts. Newel told the Sentinel on Friday that establishments must comply by Monday.

“If you are gathering with extended family and friends, especially those who have traveled from outside the area or who are unvaccinated, caution is best,” Newel said. “We want to try to get used to the idea of living with this virus and getting back to some sort of normalcy in activities, including being able to gather with people that we love and not have to withhold ourselves from our kids, our grandkids or our grandparents.”

The directive has no expiration date currently, Newel said, but the health office will monitor the case rate, the virus reproductive number, which gauges community transmission, and the test positivity rate to determine when it is safe to revoke it.

“Those are the three main things to watch but our big concern is also saving lives so we will be watching deaths and, additionally, the impacts on our health care system,” Newel said. “There has been quite an increase in hospitalizations in the last week to two weeks.”

California’s COVID transmission rate is higher than many states in the South, most of which have fewer pandemic restrictions, according to data from the CDC. As of November 21, California’s seven-case average was more than twice that of Florida, despite Governor Ron Desantis’ state orders banning mask and vaccine mandates. Similarly, as of November 11, California’s seven-day death rate per 1 million people was eleven times higher than Florida’s.

The White House encouraged businesses to push workers to get vaccinated for coronavirus, despite a federal court injunction temporarily staying the Biden administration’s vaccination requirement for large employers.

When asked what the administration thinks employers should do at this stage, White House deputy press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre told reporters that employers should encourage vaccinations.

“We say, do not wait to take actions that will keep your workplace safe,” Jean-Pierre said. “People should not wait. They should continue to move forward and make sure they’re getting their workplace vaccinated.”

Jean-Pierre added, “It is important and critical to do, and waiting to get more people vaccinated will lead to more outbreaks and sickness.”

The comments come after the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals ordered an injunction against the mandate on Saturday, concluding that there could be “grave statutory and constitutional issues” with the requirement.

The outline of the mandate was released on Thursday: It will require businesses with 100 or more employees to mandate COVID-19 vaccinations for workers. Unvaccinated employees would be allowed to continue to work as long as they submit weekly COVID tests and wear a mask on the job.

President Biden ordered the Labor Department’s Occupational Safety and Health Administration to develop the mandate. However, the lawsuit filed in the Fifth Circuit by Texas, Louisiana, and various businesses, claims that the mandate does not fall under OSHA’s authority.

At least 26 states have filed suit against the mandate since Friday, according to CNBC. Biden-administration officials have insisted that OSHA retains the authority to implement the mandate.

Florida lawmakers will meet for a special legislative session Monday at Governor Ron DeSantis’s urging as part of an effort to combat vaccine mandates in the state.

The state legislature, controlled by Republicans, will deliberate on four bills over the course of a week that are designed to punish private entities and municipalities that mandate vaccination as a condition of employment.

“No cop, no firefighter, no nurse, nobody should be losing their job because of these jabs,” DeSantis said in a media release. “We’re going to be striking a blow for freedom.”

While DeSantis has advocated for the vaccine as a medical innovation, acknowledging that it’s statistically proven to reduce the severity of COVID cases, he has stood firm against coercion, maintaining that vaccination is a personal health decision.

Aubrey Jewett, a political science professor at the University of Central Florida, told Reuters that the bills, which would impose fines on businesses that don’t allow employee vaccination exemptions, are designed to bolster existing directives.

In recent months, the governor issued executive orders outlawing public employee vaccine mandates as well as mask mandates in public institutions, including K-12 schools. The latter measure has been suspended in litigation for months pending further judicial review.

“This is a combination of policy and politics,” Jewett said, noting that DeSantis is likely taking cues from former President Trump in opposing sweeping mandates, given that a large percentage of their shared voter base resides in Florida.

Republicans outperformed expectations in the 2016 and 2020 elections and the state recently registered more Republican than Democratic constituents for the first time in years.

DeSantis recently declared his re-election bid for governor but has long been considered a favorite for the 2024 GOP presidential nomination.

In a Friday-evening decision, a federal appeals court affirmed its stay of the Biden administration’s vaccine requirement for private businesses, blasting the sweeping nature of the mandate.

In the opinion, Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals judges Kurt D. Engelhardt, Edith H. Jones, and Stuart Kyle Duncan excoriated President Biden’s order as a broad overstepping of constitutional power and use of legal gymnastics. While the government claims the mandate derives its authority from a 1970s occupational-health-and-safety statute, the court argued that it “grossly exceeds OSHA’s statutory authority.”

Advertisement

Their decision asserted that, in the name of addressing what it posits is an emergency health peril, the mandate wrongfully lumps every workplace and worker into the same category. In reality, the judges noted, there are various risk levels for COVID among different demographics.

“Rather than a delicately handled scalpel, the Mandate is a one-size-fits-all sledgehammer that makes hardly any attempt to account for differences in workplaces (and workers) that have more than a little bearing on workers’ varying degrees of susceptibility to the supposedly ‘grave danger’ the Mandate purports to address,” the judges wrote.

By making employers responsible for enforcement, the judges said that the mandate will inflict financial harm on private companies with over 100 employees, heavily penalizing entities that don’t comply and forcing them to dismiss significant numbers of their labor force to avoid these fines.

The judges added that “the Mandate imposes a financial burden upon them by deputizing their participation in OSHA’s regulatory scheme, exposes them to severe financial risk if they refuse or fail to comply, and threatens to decimate their workforces (and business prospects) by forcing unwilling employees to take their shots, take their tests, or hit the road.”

The court’s decision on Friday comes after it issued a temporary halt to the mandate last week and agreed to review it on an expedited basis “because the petitions give cause to believe there are grave statutory and constitutional issues with the Mandate, the Mandate is hereby STAYED pending further action by this court.”

In the wake of the National School Board Association’s letter to the Biden administration requesting federal intervention to penalize parents who protest at school-board meetings, 23 state chapters have now distanced themselves from the headquarters, and seven have disassociated altogether.

After the New Hampshire, Missouri, Louisiana, Pennsylvania, and Ohio state school-board associations ended their memberships with the NSBA, citing grievances with its decision to engage the Biden administration without first consulting them, South Carolina and Montana followed their example and severed ties Monday.

On November 1 in South Carolina, 35 state lawmakers petitioned for their school-board group chapter to withdraw from the NSBA, a show of force that likely added pressure for the ultimate vote to leave a week later.

“After careful deliberation, the Board voted to withdraw SCSBA’s membership from NSBA effective immediately and request a refund of SCSBA’s 2021–2022 membership dues,” the SCSBA wrote in its membership-termination letter.

The chapter slammed the NSBA for taking insufficient action to remedy the harm inflicted by its letter, which prompted Attorney General Merrick Garland to mobilize the FBI in collaboration with federal law enforcement to probe and potentially prosecute parents founds guilty of “threatening” school administrators.

“Aside from an October 22 letter of apology to state associations, NSBA has taken few steps to mitigate the negative impact of the letter on many states including South Carolina,” the statement added.

The Montana chapter echoed South Carolina’s objections to the headquarter in its departure letter, specifying that it will formally discontinue its partnership next summer rather than immediately. For Montana, the precursor for leaving was the NSBA’s communication with the White House asking the DOJ to investigate parents for criminal infractions in cases where parents criticized curriculum changes and COVID protocols.

“The final straw was a letter written by the interim CEO and NSBA president in September asking President Joe Biden for federal law enforcement assistance to deal with threats of violence and intimidation over COVID-19 requirements at schools,” the MSBA wrote.

Chairman of the Federal Reserve Jerome Powell, recently nominated by President Biden to serve a second term, warned Monday that the Omicron variant of COVID recently discovered in South Africa could inflame supply-chain bottlenecks and inflationary pressures plaguing the economy.

Released in written form Monday, Powell’s testimony will be delivered during a hearing before the Senate Banking Committee on Tuesday morning.

“The recent rise in COVID-19 cases and the emergence of the Omicron variant pose downside risks to employment and economic activity and increased uncertainty for inflation,” Powell wrote. “Greater concerns about the virus could reduce people’s willingness to work in person, which would slow progress in the labor market and intensify supply-chain disruptions.”

After a number of consecutive years of undershooting its 2 percent inflation target, the Fed has far exceeded this rate in the last year of the pandemic, which has seen price surges across consumer commodities and services. Powell confirmed this, noting that inflation increased 5 percent in October from a year earlier and that the metric is “running well above” the central bank’s 2 percent goal.

Powell added that production and delivery stoppages have inhibited producers from creating enough supply to satiate robust demand across industrial sectors, meaning inflation may not relent just yet. The rising costs of oil and housing are also contributing to inflation’s upward trend.

While economists had projected inflation to “move down significantly over the next year as supply and demand imbalances abate,” the Fed chief said, that outlook has changed given the emergence of Omicron. “It now appears that factors pushing inflation upward will linger well into next year,” he commented.

After many months of rapidly expanding its balance sheet by conducting large-scale asset purchases of $120 billion worth a month, the Fed moved in early November to slightly taper off this program, reducing these buy-outs by $15 billion each in November and December. The sooner the Fed ends this program, the more flexibility it will have to hike rates to counter inflation if it spirals to dangerous levels.

Powell, however, said the Fed plans not to raise rates, which are currently hovering around zero, until the economy achieves maximum employment.

“There is still ground to cover to reach maximum employment for both employment and labor market participation, and we expect progress to continue,” he said.

The first case of the Omicron COVID variant in the U.S. has emerged in California, the CDC announced Wednesday.

“The California and San Francisco Departments of Public Health have confirmed that a recent case of COVID-19 among an individual in California was caused by the Omicron variant (B.1.1.529),” the CDC wrote in a statement.

During a White House press briefing Wednesday, Dr. Fauci said the case was detected in an individual who traveled from South Africa on November 22 and tested positive for the virus on November 29.

Fauci added that the individual is self-quarantining to prevent further transmission and close contacts have not contracted the variant so far. He said that the person was fully vaccinated and has “mild symptoms, which are improving at this point.”

Originating in South Africa, the Omicron strain appears to be highly infectious but less virulent than its Delta counterpart and the original version that spread across the globe in the spring of 2019, scientists have suggested. Since the emergence of the new variant, President Biden imposed a travel ban on November 26 on eight African countries that could pose a risk of importing the disease, including South Africa, Botswana, Zimbabwe, Namibia, Lesotho, Eswatini, Mozambique, and Malawi.

Last week, scientists with the World Health Organization characterized Omicron as a “variant of concern” that could potentially evade the protection of the current vaccine and natural immunity provided by prior infection and recovery.

On Sunday, Dr. Fauci acknowledged that travel moratoriums can only “delay” the spread of the Omicron variant.

‘Travel bans, when you have a highly transmissible virus, never completely would…prevent it from coming into the country. No way that’s going to happen,” he told host George Stephanopoulos on ABC’s This Week. “What you can do is, you can delay it enough to get us better prepared.” Fauci elaborated that the travel restrictions can provide the U.S. a window of time to research the new variant and boost vaccination rates in preparation.

On Wednesday, Fauci emphasized the importance of Americans getting the first set of vaccinations as well as the booster shot, recently approved by the FDA under emergency authorization for adults, even though he admitted a new vaccine may need to be developed to combat this specific variant. For now, he noted, the definition of fully vaccinated means a person received the original two Pfizer or Moderna doses or the single Johnson and Johnson dose, although he said “that could change.”

When Brandon Trosclair discovered that President Biden’s vaccine requirement for private businesses would apply to his grocery stores in Louisiana and Mississippi, his first concern was for his employees who have expressed fear and uncertainty about getting vaccinated against COVID-19 or losing their jobs.

Trosclair, who owns 16 grocery stores and employs nearly 500 workers, called the Louisiana-based Pelican Institute for Public Policy to ask for help in fighting the mandate, which will force businesses with 100 or more employees to require workers to be fully vaccinated or be tested at least once a week. The Pelican Institute and the national law firm Liberty Justice Center partnered to file a lawsuit on behalf of Trosclair and six employees of Texas-based CaptiveAire Systems.

“I felt it was not only the right thing to do, but kind of a no-brainer to file a lawsuit against this mandate and try to stop it,” the second-generation grocery-store owner told National Review.

The suit led the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals to halt the vaccine requirement, as judges on the court blasted the president’s order as a broad overreach that “grossly exceeds OSHA’s statutory authority.”

Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals judges Kurt D. Engelhardt, Edith H. Jones, and Stuart Kyle Duncan argued that the mandate wrongfully groups every workplace and worker into the same category.

“Rather than a delicately handled scalpel, the Mandate is a one-size-fits-all sledgehammer that makes hardly any attempt to account for differences in workplaces (and workers) that have more than a little bearing on workers’ varying degrees of susceptibility to the supposedly ‘grave danger’ the Mandate purports to address,” the judges wrote.

The order, which makes employers responsible for enforcement, will cause financial harm to private companies with more than 100 employees, the judges said, by forcing businesses to fire significant numbers of their labor force or to face fines for non-compliance.

The judges added that “the Mandate imposes a financial burden upon them by deputizing their participation in OSHA’s regulatory scheme, exposes them to severe financial risk if they refuse or fail to comply, and threatens to decimate their workforces (and business prospects) by forcing unwilling employees to take their shots, take their tests, or hit the road.”

Trosclair’s business has rolled with the punches in recent months, whether it be adapting to mask mandates or other COVID-19-safety measures, enabling customers to do more online shopping or adjusting to product shortages caused by supply-chain issues. But he says the vaccine mandate would deal a severe blow to his business and his employees.

“Unfortunately, now we have an administration in Washington that is truly playing politics,” he said. “We believe it’s a vast overreach for the federal government to come in and get me involved as a business owner in the medical decisions of my staff.”

Trosclair noted that he is not “anti-vaccine,” but rather “anti-mandate,” adding that he is against business owners having to get involved with the “personal medical decisions of our employees.”

“My biggest concern would be my staff,” said Trosclair, who has been working in the grocery business since he was 15.

Trosclair’s parents bought a grocery store in 2000 and ultimately grew their operation to include two more stores. He bought his parents out in 2017 and grew the business to 16 stores.

He noted that a number of his staff are “truly concerned and scared for their jobs, as well as their health” and said he stands to lose 20 to 30 percent of his workers if the requirement is allowed to take effect in January. Losing that many employees would exacerbate the problems his stores have already faced with understaffing since the pandemic began.

“It’s going to make it that much harder to deliver our service, which is groceries and good customer service,” he said.

Asked for an explanation of the supply-chain issues afflicting the American economy on Wednesday’s edition of Morning Joe, Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg urged viewers to “think of it in terms of supply and demand,” before also citing COVID-19 and, most insistently, child care, as proximate causes.

According to Buttigieg, the appearance of supply-chain issues are not due to systemic failures, but are instead the result of sky-high demand. He added that “the pandemic continues to poke holes in our ability to get goods where they need to go.”

Pressed by host Mika Brzezinski on the role of worker shortages in creating issues, the secretary — who recently returned from a hushed-up, two month stint of paternity leave — cited child care as a major issue.

“There are a lot of things contributing to this, one of them is child care of course, which is why the president’s Build Back Better vision is gonna be good for the labor market,” he explained, before also arguing that they need to be “better jobs.”

Brzezinski countered that benefits and pay are higher than ever, and noted that “before COVID, before Biden, there was a problem with child care, and people still went to work.”

Buttigieg again asserted that child care is “a greater crunch than ever,” before once again pitching Build Back Better, a $1.75 trillion spending bill being championed by the Biden administration even as inflation continues to rear its head at the gas pump and grocery store.

President Biden and members of his administration have repeatedly insisted that the bill will actually alleviate inflation rather than exacerbating it by flooding an already overheated economy with money.

Brzezinski replied, “I still don’t understand, I mean, if you’re telling me that Build Back Better will bring people back to work because of much-needed and long-needed issues like child care and pre-K, that still doesn’t explain why people aren’t coming to work today.”

“Well again, I would not ignore the issue of child care,” said the cabinet member, who referred to the shortages as a “reckoning” for employers who were having to offer more attractive compensation packages than they had pre-pandemic.

The exchange occurred the same morning as a new report from the Department of Labor indicated that the consumer price index was up 6.2 percent from a year ago, a 31 year high. Inflation and supply-chain problems have resulted in dismal job approval ratings for President Joe Biden on the economy. According to a Suffolk University/USA Today poll, only 31 percent approve of his performance in the all-important area. Sixty percent disapprove.

The Biden administration announced today that all “essential, nonresident travelers crossing U.S land borders, such as truck drivers, government and emergency response officials” are required to be fully vaccinated by January 22, according to the Associated Press.

That includes, most notably, the longest land border between any two countries on the planet: the U.S.-Canada border. Headline from the Toronto Star: “A trucking nightmare: Supply chain horrors feared as thousands of unvaccinated drivers won’t be allowed to cross U.S.-Canada border.”

On Friday, Canada announced a vaccine requirement for truck drivers entering the True North strong and free, effective January 15. The Star talked to the president of the Canadian Trucking Alliance, Stephen Laskowski, and he’s not optimistic:

Based on reports from trucking companies, Laskowski estimates that up to 20 per cent of the 120,000 Canadian truckers who regularly cross into the U.S. might not be vaccinated by the time the deadline rolls around. “Even if every single company gets their vaccination rates up to 90 per cent, that’s still 12,000 drivers,” said Laskowski, who’s calling on both governments to delay the deadline.

We need every driver we can get right now, and then some. In 2020, $309 billion of freight traveled by truck between the U.S. and Canada, which was 58.8 percent of all northern-border freight, according to the Bureau of Transportation Statistics. That was 9.9 percent less than 2019. Between the pandemic recovery and the surge in spending on goods, we can expect much more than $309 billion of truck freight for 2021. Steve Bamford of the Toronto Wholesale Produce Association is quoted by the Star: “The supply chain is already broken. You can’t take 20 per cent of the workforce out of the mix and expect it not to have a major impact.”

The vaccines are good and safe, and people should get them. That doesn’t mean the federal government should mandate them, especially for truck drivers at the current moment. The administration’s priority should be waiving regulations on trucking, not adding more.

As for our other land border, with Mexico, this mandate will have little effect. As a protectionist measure to please U.S. labor unions, Mexican trucking companies are not allowed to operate freely in the U.S. When goods are shipped from Mexico to the United States, they are either transported the entire way by U.S. truckers or brought to the border by Mexican truckers and switched to a U.S. truck for the final leg of the journey.

From Pete Buttigieg blaming a lack of child care for the supply-chain crisis to Biden being more concerned with truck drivers’ vaccination status than the fact that we don’t have enough of them to begin with, it’s clear this administration is not serious about improving our transportation situation."

National Economic Council director Brian Deese said on Sunday that he and President Biden were not wrong months ago when they downplayed inflation as a short-term issue caused by the pandemic.

When Deese appeared on CNN’s State of the Union, host Jake Tapper pressed him on comments he and the president made in June minimizing the severity of rising inflation in the U.S.

At the time, Biden said that “the overwhelming consensus is it’s going to pop up a little bit and then go back down, no one’s talking about this great, great deal.”

Deese said months ago that, “to the degree that people are focused on inflationary pressures in the short term, that really is not the issue.”

Tapper asked Deese if he and Biden were wrong and inflation is not a “short-term ‘pop up a little bit and then go back down’ issue,” especially after Biden finally acknowledged this week that inflation is “worrisome.” A Labor Department report released last week showing that inflation had reached a 31-year high.

“No, I don’t think so, Jake,” Deese replied. “I think what we have said consistently is that the pandemic and the economy are interlinked and certainly we saw just as the Delta variant posed real health challenges to the economy it also had economic impacts.”

He added that inflation is a global issue caused by supply-chain challenges associated with COVID-19.

Deese said that the bipartisan infrastructure bill, which Biden is set to sign tomorrow, is the “most significant step” that the country will take in decades to “actually invest in the arteries that help move goods more quickly through the economy.”

He also said that the Democrats’ $1.75 trillion social-spending package will ease inflationary pressures, echoing what President Biden has claimed in recent days.

“Inflation is high right now and it is affecting consumers in their pocketbook and also in their outlook for the economy. But those concerns underscore why it’s so important that we move forward on the Build Back Better legislation,” Deese said.

“This, more than anything, will go at the cost that Americans face,” he added.

Republican Governor Kristi Noem, who captured the GOP limelight for her laissez-faire management of the pandemic in South Dakota, has announced that she will be seeking reelection in 2022.

Noem made the announcement on Friday night in a Youtube video release.

“Three years ago, I asked you to trust me in our state as your governor. I have worked every day since to make our state safer, stronger, and healthier for our kids and our grandkids. It has been the honor of a lifetime to serve you,” she said. “Together we’re setting an example for the nation.”

Noem’s running mate for lieutenant governor is the incumbent Larry Rhoden. She has so far fundraised over $10 million for the race, according to the Argus Leader.

Noem and Florida Republican governor Ron DeSantis, who also just recently announced his reelection bid to the office, have long been deemed favorites for the 2024 GOP presidential nomination. Both rising stars in the movement have earned praise from Republican lawmakers and constituents for taking a hands-off approach to the COVID crisis, leaving individual liberty largely in tact and allowing families to make their own health decisions.

After some Republican governors, including DeSantis, locked down their states in the early stages of the pandemic as a precautionary measure, Noem criticized them for backtracking and acting as if they had never shut down businesses or enacted the same restrictions as many Democratic states did. Noem has touted that South Dakota never imposed lockdowns or mandates.

However, Noem came under scrutiny when she refused to ban transgender individuals from women’s sports, as many of her GOP governor counterparts had done, which prompted backlash from conservative circles. While she insisted that the logic behind her vetoing that particular bill in March 2021 was to protect the state from costly and crippling legal retaliation from athletic organizations such as the NCAA, it was later revealed that the governor had business entanglements that may have compromised her on the issue.

On the vaccine-mandate debate, Noem has vowed not to prohibit companies from requiring the shot as a condition of employment, citing her belief in nonintervention in the private sector. She is, however, suing the Biden administration over its vaccine mandate for federal contract employees.

During a hearing before the Senate Banking Committee Tuesday, chairman of the Federal Reserve Jerome Powell said the word “transitory” should be retired because of the public confusion it creates and because it may no longer reflect the current reality of persistent inflation.

Republican Senator Pat Toomey asked Powell how the central bank could maintain the position that inflation is a temporary phenomenon, given that the metric has far surpassed the annual two percent target set by the Fed. The chairman acknowledged this, adding that the economy had been undershooting the Fed’s inflation target for many consecutive years prior, so the last year of pandemic-induced price surges well compensates for it.

“I think the word ‘transitory’ has different meanings to different people. To many it carries a sense of short-lived. We tend to use it to mean that it won’t leave a permanent mark in the former of higher inflation. I think it’s probably a good time to retire that word and try to explain more clearly what we mean,” Powell said.

As production bottlenecks and the supply chain crisis persists, Powell said a reassessment of the inflation outlook for the country is due. No longer a summer of short-term price hikes, the shortages on store shelves and higher costs across consumer commodities have inflicted real pain on many Americans’ finances and quality of life that is likely to endure past the winter.

“Clearly the risk of more persistent inflation has risen,” Powell warned. The expiration date for the price increases “has been pushed out repeatedly as supply side problems have not really improved,” he added. He did not specify how those supply squeezes could be rectified so producers can meet demand, allowing market forces to settle and prices to relax.

To give itself more breathing room to raise interest rates, a monetary tool that can be used to combat spiraling inflation, the Fed is considering tapering off its large-scale asset purchasing program earlier than previously indicated.

“It is appropriate, I think, for us to discuss at out next meeting, which is in a couple of weeks, whether it will be appropriate to wrap up our purchases a few months earlier,” Powell said Tuesday. “In those two weeks we are going to get more data and learn more about the new variant.”

Powell did not say, however, whether the emergence of the Omicron COVID variant could cause the Fed to reevaluate this strategy and resume large asset buy-outs.

Well, the jobs numbers were a little confusing.

The Financial Times explains, wisely deploying the word “complex”:

Employers . . . added just 210,000 jobs for the month, a steep drop-off from the 546,000 positions created in October and well below economists’ forecasts of 550,000. Since the start of the year, monthly gains have averaged 555,000.

Doesn’t look great, but:

Despite the slower-than-expected pick-up in November, the unemployment rate fell significantly, dipping 0.4 percentage points to 4.2 per cent. Less than six months ago, it hovered closer to 6 per cent.

Well, good.

The New York Times’ Neil Irwin offers at least a partial explanation for the slowdown in job creation:

Soft job creation numbers may also be evidence of a tight labor market. Employers may want to add jobs in larger numbers, but are constrained by the number of workers they’re able to find. That story is certainly consistent with many business surveys and anecdotes about labor shortage issues.

There’s probably something to that.

Back to the Financial Times:

“With this report, we get more evidence that the economy has re-accelerated from a bit of a slowdown in the third quarter,” said Ellen Gaske, an economist at PGIM Fixed Income. She pointed to the discrepancy in the two surveys that comprise the jobs report, with one measuring households and the other employers. The “establishment” survey suggested a sharp slowdown in hiring, while the “household” survey showed a gain of 1.1m.

Are statistics in the age of COVID all that they might be? For what it’s worth, the data released today included decent upwards revisions to the number of job gains for both September and October.

It’s an iron rule that a single day’s data releases are not too determinative of anything, but a couple of takeaways seem fair enough.

The first is that — so far as employment is concerned — we are edging back toward the pre-COVID normal (I’ll make no comment about inflation).

The Financial Times:

The so-called labour force participation rate, which has stagnated since June 2020, ticked up to 61.8 per cent for November from 61.6 per cent in October, although is still about 1.5 percentage points lower than the pre-pandemic threshold.

Some of that decline will reflect the supposed “Great Retirement,” although I wonder how durable that phenomenon will really prove, particularly if inflation — no friend to those on fixed incomes — continues to bite.

The Financial Times:

For “prime age” workers aged between 24 and 54, the employment-to-population ratio, which tracks the percentage of Americans in the age bracket who currently have jobs, improved substantially in November, rising to 78.8 per cent, from 78.3 per cent the previous month. That is the highest level since early 2020.

However, there are still 3.9 million more Americans out of work than there were before the pandemic.

So, there is still quite some way to go, and that some way may be extended because of the Omicron variant, or, perhaps more likely, because of government overreaction to Omicron. This new variant must, of course, be taken seriously. However, a panic-stricken overreaction is not taking it seriously, but an evasion of the sort of thinking that is needed in the face of a problem of this nature. One way or another, we are going to have to “live with” this virus. That’s not a takeaway from these numbers, but it is a takeaway unchanged by them. It’s worth pointing out that retail employment actually declined (albeit by a small number, some 20,000), and leisure and hospitality jobs were flat. These are sectors that will be hit very hard in the event of an Omicron panic.

Meanwhile, the FT notes that “average hourly earnings rose another 0.3 percent month over month in November, the slowest monthly pace since March, bringing the annual pace of wage growth to 4.8 per cent.” Comparing these numbers with the data since March 2020 is tricky, as much of those were distorted by changes in the composition of the workforce. Thus the spike in the spring of 2020 reflected the fact that lower-paid workers suffered a disproportionate percentage of the jobs lost when the pandemic struck. Equally, the decline in wage growth seen briefly earlier this year was, at least partially, a reflection of the return of more of the lower-paid into the workforce.

It is thus more useful to compare wage growth with data from before the pandemic, when annual growth rates were around 3 percent. The comparison suggests some wage pressure now, but perhaps not an inordinate amount. In fact, this was the lowest month-on-month figure for wage growth since March, and was indeed slightly below expectations. That might well be in line with the uptick in people joining the workforce: Even if they are still not the whole way there (see Irwin’s comment about possible difficulties in filling jobs), are employers now beginning to find wage levels that will secure them the workers they need? (The ending of various federal pandemic-relief programs will have almost certainly played its part in this too, as will the inevitable erosion of any savings accumulated during the pandemic.)

The Times’ Irwin sees the overall picture in rosy terms:

The speed with which unemployment has gone from a grave crisis to a benign situation is astounding. Unemployment was 6.7 percent last December. In one year, we’ve experienced an improvement that took three and a half years in the last economic cycle (March 2014 to September 2017).

There’s no doubt that we have seen a remarkable turnaround, but we should forget neither the extraordinary amounts of money thrown at the problem, nor the fact that this crisis was brought about by, so to speak, a bolt from the blue (and almost certainly exacerbated by some of the steps taken by governments to deal with it). The latter type of crisis is very different from one that was home-grown and created by flaws within the financial system. The cure for that was always likely to take time, “financial” crises tend to.

Edmund Andrews, writing for the Stanford School of Business in 2019:

A new study of financial crises going back to 1870, coauthored by Arvind Krishnamurthy at Stanford Graduate School of Business, finds that the recession of 2007–09 played out pretty much as expected . . . If anything, Krishnamurthy says, the recovery that began in 2009 was quicker than the historical patterns would have suggested.

And my last takeaway from today’s data (so far) is that they are no reason to reverse the acceleration of the taper now advocated by the Fed.

The NYT’s Irwin:

[A] more aggressive tapering plan from the Fed will be an effort to adjust its policy stance with the facts on the ground without causing too much disruption to markets or the economy. If the Fed succeeds, the economy will keep growing steadily and the labor market will continue its gradual improvement. But it’s worth noting just how rapid the improvement has already been. In February — a mere nine months ago — the Congressional Budget Office was forecasting the unemployment rate would be 5.3 percent in the current quarter. It has ended up a full percentage point below that level. Ultimately, this has been a speedy labor market recovery, and one that appears to have more room to run. Policymakers have every reason to take the win and continue adjusting to that reality."

The Biden administration will rely on workplace whistleblowers to enforce its new vaccine mandate for companies with more than 100 employees, given that the U.S. Labor Department’s Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) does not have nearly enough inspectors to check in on every company impacted by the rule, which will effect an estimated 84 million employees, according to a new report.

A federal appeals court in New Orleans last week issued an injunction temporarily halting the Biden administration’s vaccination requirement for large employers, citing “grave statutory and constitutional issues.” However, if the policy goes into effect — requiring workers to be fully vaccinated by January 4 or be tested weekly and wear a mask on the job — the Associated Press reports that it is concerned employees who will largely be responsible for helping OSHA enforce the mandate.

Debbie Berkowitz, a former OSHA chief of staff who is a fellow at Georgetown University’s Kalmanovitz Initiative for Labor and the Working Poor, told the AP that there is “no army of OSHA inspectors that is going to be knocking on employers’ door of even calling them.”

“They’re going to rely on workers and their union representatives to file complaints where the company is totally flouting the law,” she added.

Advertisement

Twenty to 25 percent of OSHA inspections take place in response to a complaint.

“You fill out a form or somebody fills out a form for you,” Berkowitz said. “And that’s all workers have. If OSHA decides not to inspect, that’s it. Or if OSHA inspects but decides not to cite the employer, that’s it. … So it’s a pretty weak law.”

Jim Frederick, the acting chief of OSHA, said the agency will focus on job sites “where workers need assistance to have a safe and healthy workplace.”

“That typically comes through in the form of a complaint,” Frederick added, according to the AP.

While experts say most companies are likely to comply with the vaccine mandate, as they do with other OSHA rules, opponents to the rule have noted that whistleblowers often receive retaliation from their employers and that OSHA offers little protection when that happens.

OSHA was first established 50 years ago to enforce workplace safety and protect workers from a slew of dangers including toxic chemicals, unsafe ladders and cave-ins at construction sites, and has jurisdiction in 29 states. In other states, federally approved workplace safety agencies perform the same job. Some 1,850 inspectors will oversee 130 million workers at 8 million job sites if the rule takes effect.

While companies legally can’t retaliate against workers for raising a health or safety issue or filing an OSHA complaint, “retaliation is rampant,” Berkowitz said.

The Labor Department’s Inspector General last year found that OSHA “needs to improve its handling of whistleblower complaints.”

“When OSHA fails to respond in a timely manner, it could leave workers to suffer emotionally and financially, and may also lead to the erosion of key evidence and witnesses,” the internal watchdog said.

President Biden had a tense exchange with a reporter on Saturday who pressed the president over his previous comments disputing a Wall Street Journal report that the administration is considering issuing $450,000 payments to illegal immigrants who were separated from their families at the southern border under the Trump administration.

“You said last week that this report about migrant families at the border getting payments was garbage,” the reporter said, before Biden interrupted him to say, “No, I didn’t say that.”

“Let’s get it straight,” the president said. “You said everybody coming across the border gets 450,000 dollars.”

The reporter then clarified, “So the number is what you had the problem with?”

Biden responded that it was the number he took issue with.

“If in fact, because of the outrageous behavior of the last administration, you coming across the border — whether it was legal or illegal — and you lost your child,” Biden said, raising his voice and pointing his finger. “You lost your child, he’s gone, you deserve some kind of compensation no matter what the circumstances.”

He said he has “no idea” what the final settlement figure will be.

Biden’s comments come after he was asked by a Fox News reporter on Wednesday about the Wall Street Journal report; the reporter asked if the payments could serve as an incentive for more illegal immigrants to try to enter the U.S.

“If you guys keep sending that garbage out, yeah,” Biden responded. “But it’s not true.”

The reporter then asked Biden whether this is “this is a garbage report” and Biden said, “Yeah.”

“Four hundred and fifty thousand dollars per person. Is that what you’re saying?” Biden asked, then said, “that’s not gonna happen.”

One day later, White House deputy press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre told reporters that Biden had been commenting on “the dollar figure that was mentioned,” not on settling with the families.

She said that, “if it saves taxpayer dollars and puts the disastrous history of the previous administration’s use of ‘zero tolerance‘ and family separation behind us,” the president is “perfectly comfortable with the Department of Justice settling with the individuals and families who are currently in litigation with the US government.”

She did not disclose what figure Biden would support. American Civil Liberties Union executive director Anthony D. Romero told CNN that the Justice Department warned people involved in the negotiations that “the numbers reported in the press are higher than anywhere that settlement can land,” following Biden’s comments on Wednesday.

The report by the Wall Street Journal said that the U.S. Departments of Justice, Homeland Security, and Health and Human Services are weighing the payments as they work to resolve lawsuits claiming that the government subjected parents and children to lasting psychological trauma.

The report says that most of the families included one parent and one child who crossed the border illegally from Mexico and that many families would likely get smaller payouts, dependent on their circumstances.

While the American Civil Liberties Union says about 5,500 children were separated from their families at the border under the Trump administration, government officials expect that the number of families eligible under the potential settlement will be smaller. Still, the total payout could cost the government more than $1 billion, the report said.

Some government lawyers see the payouts as excessive for illegal immigrants who broke the law by crossing the border, according to the report. It added that a government lawyer threatened to remove his name from the case in protest of the potential settlement offer.

With homicides peaking at 500 in November, Philadelphia has just reached — and is likely to exceed — its murder record, previously set in 1990.

Amid the development that the city had reached this record, Mayor Jim Kenney lamented the rise of gun violence and declared creating a safe community a priority for his administration.

“I never stop thinking about the victims and their families and the incredible loss these senseless deaths leave behind. And as we enter this holiday season, I can’t help [but] think of all the incredible potential that has been extinguished by the loss of life,” he said Wednesday.

Kenney touted a recent initiative in collaboration with law enforcement, called Operation Pinpoint Strategy, to curb crime and “take record numbers of guns off the streets.”

“Every one of these guns off the streets is one less that could be used to harm or kill Philadelphians,” he said. The startling surge in violence largely coincided with the COVID pandemic, which wrought economic and social distress across the country, resulting in higher unemployment.

In June, Philadelphia’s city council authorized a fiscal 2022 budget that allocates over $155 million in violence-prevention programs to reduce gun violence. Out of that total, $22 million in grants is designated for organizations focused on “reducing violence through trauma-informed healing and restorative practices and safe havens and mentorship,” according to NBC Philadelphia.

“Each and every homicide carries with it a profound sense of loss,” Philadelphia Police Commissioner Danielle Outlaw said in a statement. “However, for our City to have reached such a tragic milestone – 500 lives cut short – it carries a weight that is almost impossible to truly comprehend.”

Outlaw suggested that her department is dealing with low morale because of the mixed rhetoric vacillating between demanding greater police presence and demanding their defunding or abolition. Like many police bureaus nationwide, Outlaw suggested that hers is struggling with officer recruiting and retention because of the confusing cues from the public.

“How do we figure out what our roles are when our narratives are vacillating between: ‘We want more cops,’ ‘No we don’t,’ ‘Defund,’ and, ‘By the way, we want you to do these additional things but we don’t believe it’s OK to give you resources to do it,” Outlaw told Whyy.org. “It was a lot of counter-intuitive, conflicting narratives happening all at once with us caught in the middle of that.”

Jamal Johnson, a local resident who participated in a hunger strike to raise awareness for gun violence in the city, finally ended the protest when the mayor agreed to meet with him to discuss the issue.

“The people I talk with every day have a sense of lawlessness in their neighborhoods. They feel like the people who do get caught get off and those who don’t get caught are just doing it over and over again. They feel our government has given up,” Johnson told NBC Philadelphia.

Welcome back to “Forgotten Fact-Checks,” a weekly column produced by National Review’s News Desk. This week, we investigate the curious case of the “killer car,” check in on how some progressive commentators celebrated Thanksgiving, and explore more media misses.

The Killer Car

Darrell Brooks, the suspect in the Waukesha car-collision massacre that killed six people and left dozens wounded, has a lengthy rap sheet: domestic abuse, battery, disorderly conduct, recklessly endangering safety, bail-jumping felony, and resisting or obstructing an officer. As he drove his car into a crowd attending a Christmas parade in Waukesha, Wis., last week, Brooks faced multiple pending cases in Milwaukee County involving second-degree reckless endangerment and being a felon in possession of a firearm.

According to Milwaukee County’s Democratic district attorney, John Chisholm, an “inappropriately low” $1,000 cash bond in the pending cases allowed Brooks to leave prison in a matter of days, after which he drove into the crowd.

But you won’t see this in most mainstream news reports.

The outlets have turned a blind eye toward Brooks, who exemplifies what can go terribly, tragically wrong when little to no bail is set.

A New York Times headline sums up why many outlets will choose to ignore the story, which sits outside of the progressive narrative: “Waukesha Suspect’s Previous Release Agitates Efforts to Overhaul Bail.”

The article describes prosecutors’ “fast, fateful decision” to ask that “bond for a 39-year-old repeat offender accused of brutalizing his girlfriend, then running over her with an S.U.V., be set at only $1,000.”

However, while the Times notes that the decision has “brought criticism raining down” on the DA, it then shifts the blame from him to “happenstance.”

“It appears, though, that the controversial release may have been not a policy decision, but the result of happenstance and other factors — an inexperienced junior prosecutor and a rushed supervisor up against a huge backlog of cases that piled up during the coronavirus pandemic,” the article says.

Meanwhile, CNN on Sunday took its ignorance of facts one step further in reporting that Waukesha “will hold a moment of silence today, marking one week since a car drove through a city Christmas parade, killing six people and injuring scores of others.”

While CNN may initially have readers believe that a fully autonomous car plowed through a crowd, it does acknowledge in the final paragraph of the story that it is Brooks who allegedly killed six people, including an eight-year-old boy. The story does not include Brooks’s criminal background or that he was released on unusually low bail when the crime occurred.

After social-media backlash, CNN updated its headline to say that “a man plowed a vehicle through a Christmas parade.”

The Washington Post took a similar phantom-car perspective, writing in a tweet: “Here’s what we know so far on the sequence of events that led to the Waukesha tragedy caused by a SUV.”

However, neither outlet had difficulty identifying the perpetrator of other crimes, including in the case of James Alex Fields Jr., whom the Washington Post wrote “plowed his car through a crowd of protesters on August 12, 2017, striking four . . . and killing 32-year-old Heather Heyer” during a Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville, Va.

CNN reported that Fields “sped his car through a crowd of counterprotesters, injuring dozens and killing 32-year-old Heather Heyer.”

Both outlets also identified Kyle Rittenhouse as the suspect in the fatal shooting of two people during rioting in Kenosha, Wis., last year and delved into his background and mindset as a killer.

In these cases, the outlets understood that it was not a car nor a gun that was at fault, even if neither extended this same perspective to the tragedy in Waukesha.

Reporter or Spokesman?

Politico’s White House editor might be better suited for a role as a White House spokesman. Sam Sten dinged the Wall Street Journal editorial board for its observation that “Joe Biden has done no better than Donald Trump in defeating COVID,” arguing that the take “lacks and real context; either what this papers [sic] owner has done to spread disinformation and vax skepticism or what Biden inherited.” Biden’s inheritance included working vaccines developed under the Trump administration, as well as more effective treatment options than had been available at the start of the pandemic.

Before becoming president-elect, Biden and his running mate availed themselves of every opportunity to sow doubt about the vaccines, with Biden saying “if Donald Trump can’t give answers, and his administration cannot give answers . . . the American people should not have confidence,” in the coronavirus vaccines. Kamala Harris declared during the vice-presidential debate that “if Donald Trump tells us that we should take it, I’m not taking it.”

Headline Fail of the Week

The Atlantic suggested just ahead of the holiday last week that you “Deprogram your relatives this Thanksgiving.” The Molly Jong-Fast column suggests: “Maybe you’ll change a heart or a mind. Or maybe you’ll need to report a relative to the FBI.”

Advertisement

The column was later amended to read: “Maybe you’ll change a heart or a mind. Or not! Either way, it’s something to do besides just eat.”

Jong-Fast later issued an apology on Twitter:

It was meant to be funny but I am so sorry if I hurt anyones feelings. It was meant to be a humor essay. — Molly Jong-Fast (@MollyJongFast) November 24, 2021

Media Misses

-Yale philosophy professor and author of How Fascism Works Jason Stanley “had not appreciated how dangerous @TheAtlantic is to democratic institutions until recently.” As you can tell, we have no special love for The Atlantic here, but publishing articles critical of higher education hardly represents an attack on democracy itself. One is left to wonder if Stanley’s attack on the free press could also, under his framework, be fairly characterized as a danger to democracy.

–An opinion piece at CNN muses that a Democratic ticket consisting of a Kamala Harris—Pete Buttigieg team-up in 2024 would give Democrats “a very strong ticket in 2024 that would seem like a natural continuation of Biden’s first term.” Recent polling indicates that Harris has an approval rating of 28 percent, which would make her the most unpopular presidential nominee of all time, and Buttigieg, the secretary of transportation, has suggested that Americans tired of paying more at the pump should purchase an electric car. Meanwhile, Biden’s approval rating is underwater by about 8.5 points, per the FiveThirtyEight average, so it’s not clear that Americans are actively seeking out a natural continuation of his first term.

-Former governor and current MSNBC contributor Howard Dean reacted to the verdicts in the trial of Ahmaud Arbery’s killers, as well as the Kyle Rittenhouse case, by tweeting “​​America is turned upside down. A Nearly all white Jury in Georgia returns a guilty verdict against three white men who chased down and killed a Black man. A Wisconsin jury and good old boy judge let a young white man armed with an illegal gun go free after killing two white boys.” Perhaps Dean should consider the implications here more fully.

-Twitter’s new CEO shared some thoughts on free speech during an interview with Technology Review in February:

“Our role is not to be bound by the First Amendment, but our role is to serve a healthy public conversation and our moves are reflective of things that we believe lead to a healthier public conversation,” said Parag Agrawal, who has been CTO since 2017 and has worked at Twitter since 2011. “The kinds of things that we do about this is, focus less on thinking about free speech, but thinking about how the times have changed.”

What could possibly go wrong with this guy at the helm?

–Axios reporter Andrew Solender “walked into Thanksgiving dinner and was handed a printed-out National Review article. Off to a good start.” Indeed.

Somehow I don’t think that Larry Summers is expecting the Twenties to roar very loudly.

Bloomberg:

Former U.S. Treasury Secretary Larry Summers said global financial markets appear to be anticipating slow growth and low real interest rates for the next few years, which will gut the ability of central banks to guide economies. “What markets are seeming to price is a return to secular stagnation, or Japanization,” Summers said in a lecture to the London School of Economics on Wednesday.

Calculating what markets are pricing in at any given point is not a precise science (#understatement), especially at a time when the Fed’s policies are also distorting the price of money (interest rates). Nevertheless, running through Summers’s comment is the implication that the extent of that distortion should not be overestimated. Companies do not appear to be in a hurry to put money to work, and (to oversimplify) that means money would be “cheap” anyway.

Bloomberg:

The remarks build on [Summers’s] view since 2013 that one of the chief problems in industrial nations is an excess of savings and lack of investment.

At least part of the reason for that lack of investment — as I discussed here and here — is, I suspect, that the financial crisis (and memories of the financial crisis) “scarred” managements in a way that led them to re-evaluate their perceptions of risk. If the “impossible” had happened, it could happen again. That meant that the potential return managers would have to expect before undertaking a new project would have to be higher than it would have been beforehand. The “impossible” has, of course, now returned, this time in the shape of COVID, and it too is likely to leave scars — something that, as I also mentioned before, those responsible for the original work on scarring had considered.

To quote (again) the St. Louis Fed’s Julian Kozlowski:

Perception can be everything: People observe new events and use these experiences to inform their expectations. For example, if you haven’t seen many pandemics, you think pandemics are rare. However, when you see a pandemic, you come to believe that pandemics are not as rare as you previously thought . . . Consciously or not, we all use past events to inform our beliefs, like econometricians do. Rare events are those for which we have little data. In turn, the scarcity of data makes new rare events particularly informative, so rare events trigger larger belief revisions. Furthermore, because it will take many more observations of non-rare events to convince someone that a rare event really is unlikely, these changes in expectations are particularly persistent.

Somehow I have the suspicion that the evident reluctance of some in government to relax COVID-related restrictions will only make that scarring worse.

Whatever the causes of this depressed investment demand, Summers (Bloomberg reports) believes that it will constrain the ability of policy-makers to use increased interest rates as a way of stabilizing the economy (an increase in the price of a good for which demand is weak isn’t going to be very helpful). Summers believes, according to the report, that that task will fall to government, a worrying prospect at a time when the administration’s plans — from higher taxation to increasingly onerous regulation — seem purpose-built to discourage investment. The thought that, by default, this could be used to boost the case for increased investment by the state is not a reason for celebration.

Adding to the gloom, Summers (rightly) worries about the way that ultra-low interest rates do give a fillip to one type of investment: malinvestment.

Bloomberg:

Summers also warned that low borrowing costs will add to the risk of another financial crisis. “Extremely low interest rates set the stage for leveraging and the perpetuation of zombie enterprises and the perpetuation of financial bubbles,” Summers, who is also a paid contributor to Bloomberg, said. “We’re seeing a lot of evidence of speculative risk. Extremely low and negative real interest rates are problematic.”

Indeed they are."

There’s not that much that we know about the medical effects of the Omicron variant, although if there is such a thing as an emerging consensus, it seems to be that (1) it is highly infectious and that (2) the vaccinated can catch it, but, if they do, the consequences should in most cases be relatively mild. There are even suggestions from the South African data that Omicron may not be that dangerous (these things are all relative, of course).

On that latter topic, the Daily Telegraph’s Ambrose Evans-Pritchard comments:

Scientists will know in a couple of weeks whether omicron has a lower case fatality rate than delta. They flag two obvious grounds for caution: viral infections tend to start with mild disease; and past waves show that young people tend to catch Covid first before it spreads up the age ladder. The original cohort of patients breezing through surgeries in Johannesburg with little more than a headache may be a trick of the time sequence.

It’s still early days.

So far as the economy is concerned, even before today, Fed chairman Jerome Powell had flagged the fact that Omicron might trigger further supply-chain disruptions (or presumably prolong existing ones). The implication of that is that the current inflationary surge will last even longer than was already anticipated by the Fed (until some time in the second and third quarters of 2022), bad news even if there is more to rising prices than supply-chain problems and energy prices (spoiler: There is).

Whatever is behind this inflationary moment, the fact that Powell is now (Tuesday) proposing to speed up his rather leisurely taper timetable is the right way to go.

The Wall Street Journal:

Mr. Powell said elevated inflation pressures and rapid improvements in the labor market would justify “wrapping up the taper, perhaps a few months sooner.” He joined a handful of Fed officials who said recently they would support deliberating at the Fed’s Dec. 14-15 meeting whether to accelerate the process of reducing those purchases. If officials were to quicken the pace at which they reduce the purchases by $30 billion a month after the December meeting, they could conclude the program by March, giving them more flexibility to raise rates in the first half of next year. “You’ve seen our policy adapt and you’ll see it continue to adapt” in response to concerns about more persistent inflation, Mr. Powell said.

Also, of note — “Transitory” R.I.P:

Mr. Powell backed away from the central bank’s initial characterization that elevated prices would be short-lived, or transitory. “It’s probably a good time to retire that word and explain more clearly what we mean,” he said.

And Powell made clear that, in his view, supply-chain disruptions are not, so to speak, acting alone:

Mr. Powell said he still expects that because many price increases can be traced to supply-and-demand imbalances that resulted directly from the pandemic, inflation would decline next year. “But it’s also the case that pricing increases have spread much more broadly” in recent months, he said. Mr. Powell pointed to rising energy prices, increasing rents and brisk wage gains as other factors that could keep inflation elevated. But the persistence of supply constraints remains hard to predict, and “it now appears that factors pushing inflation upward will linger well into next year,” he said.

But even if supply-chain problems are not the sole cause of the current inflationary spike, they still matter. In the context of Omicron, it is worth remembering that current supply-chain disruptions are partly (only partly) the consequences of overly draconian governmental responses to the coronavirus over the past 18 months. The question now is whether those errors are going to be repeated on enough of a scale to set back the recovery in supply chains — of which there is some evidence — and, for that matter, lead to other disasters that, at many levels, we cannot afford."

A big … [+21667 chars]",Left,"What becomes of luxury in a global pandemic? Is the pursuit of luxury incompatible with our drastically changed lives under covid? Luxury can be so external, and life lately feels so internal. A big part of luxury is theater: the couture gown that dazzles the crowd, the splendid car gliding past onlookers, the Instagrammed vacation. The admiration, desire or even envy of others creates part of luxury’s allure.

Luxury, that is, can be a group sport, involving participation of an audience that recognizes and assesses distinctions of quality or exclusivity. The playing field for this sport is rarely level, since distinctions among things lead to distinctions — and divisions — among people, enforcing hierarchies of wealth or privilege, taste or knowledge. Luxury is a social communication circuit, a language with meanings agreed upon and upheld by a collective. This is how luxury signals work.

The pandemic scrambled these signals. It isolated us physically, reducing opportunities for “performing” our luxuries. Travel was shut down or severely curtailed, as were many parties, openings, galas and all other occasions for gathering and display. Without social interaction, is luxury doomed?

Not at all, it turns out. In fact, luxury sales overall have risen during the pandemic, as the wealthiest have grown wealthier, and even the less-than-billionaire class, having been stuck at home, has accumulated more cash to spend and more time to spend it.

[The post-covid luxury spending boom has begun. It’s already reshaping the economy.]

In the process, the quest for luxury has simply expanded — encompassing not only a surging market in some traditional luxury items but also more inward-focused versions of luxury, plus novel digital methods of projecting luxury theater that are pandemic-safe. Far from disappearing, luxury has proved more central to our culture than ever. Like a river diverted by rocks, it has simply sought other paths.

The word “luxury” finds its roots in two Latin terms: “luxus,” which means sumptuousness and excess, and “luxuria,” which denotes offensiveness in a moral, even carnal sense. In Elizabethan English, “luxury” referred to lechery or adulterousness. (In “Much Ado About Nothing,” Claudio impugns Hero’s sexual chastity, claiming: “She knows the heat of a luxurious bed.”)

While we may no longer think of the pursuit of luxury as a moral or sexual vice, it remains tied to our sense of bodily, or at least sensorial, delectation. And given that covid is a physical illness, it has necessarily altered the relationship between luxury and our bodies.

The pandemic has made personal health a topic of constant anxiety and conversation. Of course, access to the finest doctors and treatments constitutes significant privilege, but health luxury extends beyond the medical. Maintaining a high level of personal fitness — a perfectly Pilatified figure, for example — has long been a sign of privilege. And in a pandemic, fitness means more.

With disease all around us, a fit body feels like symbolic armor, an escape route, protection from illness or even mortality. As Italian theorist Patrizia Calefato writes in her book “Luxury: Fashion, Lifestyle and Excess,” “luxury ... challenges the idea of death itself.” And that challenge, that protection, can be pricey. Or as Leslie Ghize, executive vice president of the forecasting firm Tobe TDG, puts it: “Wellness is a luxury … the luxury of keeping yourself in good condition.” (Ghize is a member of the board of governors at Parsons School of Design, where I am the dean of the School of Art and Design History and Theory.)

As affluent fitness and health buffs abandoned expensive group classes, gyms and private trainers (the industry lost $13.9 billion in the second half of 2020), equally upscale alternatives gained popularity. In the first seven months of the pandemic, sales revenue of home fitness equipment more than doubled, reaching over $2.3 billion.

Even the humblest workout accessories can metamorphose into luxuries: For about $3,000, fashionistas can tone up with Louis Vuitton hand weights — crafted of lustrous metal and engraved with the LV logo. Yves Saint Laurent dumbbells, in hand-cut black marble, are a relative bargain at $2,000. All are attractive enough to double as home decor when you’re done with your reps.

Maybe this is how we “do” luxury in a pandemic: attending to our bodies while simultaneously escaping, even transcending, them.

In the realm of home exercise, “connected fitness” took off during the pandemic. Equipment-plus-digital-subscription systems such as Peloton (with a $32 billion market capitalization) and Mirror (bought by Lululemon for $500 million in 2020) have attracted huge followings. With these, the luxury consists not only in acquiring gym-quality machines (costing thousands) but in gaining access to premium online classes and instructors (for additional fees). While virtual fitness predates covid, sales in this sector skyrocketed last year. (Peloton’s stock rose 440 percent during 2020, though it has lost ground lately.)

The allure of the virtual fitness space has proved enduring enough to entice even Christian Dior to plan a line of digital fitness devices, Dior Vibe, created in a collaboration between creative director Maria Grazia Chiuri and the Italian high-end fitness equipment company Technogym. So now instead of wearing Dior, couture lovers can run on wired-in Dior treadmills (and then maybe imagine their own bodies being, in a sense, “designed” by Dior).

Digital systems like these promote bodily fitness without the presence of other bodies, dematerializing the experience and removing its physical risk. Trainers, classmates and even the gym itself are reduced to pixels. And so, even as you focus on your flesh-and-blood body, you enter an alternative space — fleeing the covid-riddled ordinary world. This too is a kind of luxury, one rooted in escapism.

Hydra Studios, a gym with two branches in Manhattan and others to come in Miami and Los Angeles, takes escapism to another level. Founded in 2020 by former Wall Street professionals Marie Kloor and Dan Nielsen, Hydra specializes in what you might call “personal, dematerialized” fitness. For a monthly fee, members can reserve private fitness studios, small to midsize rooms cordoned off by heavy curtains. These miniature gyms accommodate just one person at a time. Each contains a digitally connected cardio device such as a Technogym bike, Hydrow rower or “smart” mirror, along with iPads synced to the machines that provide virtual options — group classes or digital landscapes — to help structure your workout.

Hydra’s neutral, modernist decor feels soothing, even anesthetizing. The hushed corridor of drawn white curtains makes it hard to tell if anyone else is around. The effect is disorienting: You’re at the gym, but you’re not. Among other people, or maybe not. You’re cycling or rowing through imaginary vistas (The Caribbean! The Alps!), but really sitting indoors, in a space the size of a small bedroom.

Maybe this is how we “do” luxury in a pandemic: attending to our bodies while simultaneously escaping, even transcending, them. For some, the isolation of gyms like Hydra can be a kind of alternative luxury. Kloor reports that some members find they love working out in total solitude because it frees them from worrying about how they look. Sometimes, it seems, luxury lies in the absence of display.

Luxurious — and digital — paths toward spiritual fitness have attracted many new followers during the pandemic. Like virtual physical fitness, virtual spiritual fitness offers the promise of escape, a liberation from the constraints of lockdowns, isolations and even the body itself. Spiritual wellness opens a metaphysical window in an otherwise confined world.

Aree Khodai is a pioneer in this space. As a “spiritual concierge,” she curates private experiences of transcendence for the residents of luxury apartments. Like Hydra’s founders, Khodai is a former Wall Street executive who left the grind of high finance for high wellness. After training as a yoga instructor and leading groups on self-discovery expeditions, including ayahuasca retreats, Khodai joined forces with the Society Group, a luxury real estate public relations company based in Los Angeles. Lately, the Society Group has been promoting residential amenities geared toward spiritual fitness — building perks such as meditation rooms lined with pink Himalayan salt (reputed to have air-purifying powers).

“Mid-covid, people are looking for other solutions” to enhance their well-being, says Alexander Ali, CEO of the Society Group. “Wellness has progressed beyond fitness.” At the Maverick, a luxury condo building scheduled to open in the first quarter of 2022 in New York City’s Chelsea neighborhood, and at the Park, a luxury rental complex coming soon to Santa Monica, spiritual concierges will confer with residents about their spiritual goals and hook them up with practitioners offering services such as in-home sound baths, apartment blessings or “full moon intention ceremonies.” Consultations, as well as many of the healing rituals themselves, will take place on Zoom. Khodai, who will consult with residents at the Park, will be a “spiritual guide on speed dial,” as Ali puts it, offering luxury spirituality tailor-made for the pandemic: accessible via laptop or smartphone.

The advent of “spiritual concierges” makes clear that luxury has mutated but not completely transformed under covid. In the Before Times, a hotel concierge would enhance your luxury travel experience by granting you access — to a sold-out play, perhaps, or a hot new restaurant. Today, a spiritual concierge also grants you access, but to pandemic-proof pleasures that are more metaphysical than physical, enhancing travel that occurs not over land or sea, but inwardly, in the realms of soul and spirit — without leaving your apartment.

Despite the solitary nature of the healings Khodai arranges, she stresses that her work enhances human connectivity. “Each person is a little pebble,” she says. “Their healing is affecting their friends and family.” Perhaps such “contagious healing” offers the perfect luxury antidote to a time of contagious illness.

Given that the pandemic has sent many of us on a quest for bodily and spiritual comfort, it’s unsurprising that fashion too has changed. With the near-total shutdown of work and social life, fashion took a tremendous hit, yet its role in our lives remains too vital for it to disappear entirely. More than a necessity or even a luxury, fashion is our most intimate residence — our body’s enveloping, sartorial home. And home means more now than ever.

Fashion, accordingly, has forged homier new paths, notably through the rise of “luxury comfort”: clothes emphasizing bodily wellness benefits — sensuous pleasure and physical ease, to be enjoyed more privately than publicly. “High-end comfort wear is super desirable,” says luxury expert Pauline Garris Brown, former chairman of European conglomerate LVMH North America and author of “Aesthetic Intelligence.”

Luxury comfort fashion comes in soft fabrics and forgiving shapes, featuring hidden elastic waistbands or more flowing cuts. It skims and caresses the body, freeing the wearer from discomfort and assuaging what’s been called “skin hunger,” the craving for physical touch brought on by pandemic isolation. It’s caftans by Jason Wu or floaty, prairie-style dresses by Anna Sui. It’s voluminous pants by Fendi or Stella McCartney; the easy, oversize drape of Peter Do’s fall collection. It’s athleisure — a continuing megatrend — such as the Luxe Leisure line by Reiss, puffer jackets from Gucci’s collaboration with North Face or chic tracksuits from Pyer Moss.

And above — or rather, below — it all are the breakout luxury shoes of the pandemic, whose levels of popularity now exceed anything they garnered beforehand: the cushy, pillowy, ungainly sneakers and sandals that have toppled sleek stilettos from the shelves. Gucci, Prada, Balenciaga, Chanel and Louis Vuitton all now sell rubber-platformed athletic shoes for women — in fuchsia or electric blue, embellished with crystals, flowers or couture logos — at prices that can reach $2,000. The Sculpt, the super-sleek, $600 sneaker designed by Kerby Jean-Raymond for Pyer Moss, looks like a miniature racecar. Even clunky Crocs have grabbed the limelight, showing up painted gold on Questlove or emblazoned with the Union Jack on Helen Mirren, not to mention on the feet of the Duchess of Cambridge, Ariana Grande and Drew Barrymore, among many others. (Crocs has been partnering with Balenciaga for several years now, and recent versions of their jointly created clogs start at about $650.) Couture sneakers exist for men too, including Virgil Abloh’s fabulous co-creations between Louis Vuitton and Nike, but pain-free shoes are hardly new for men.

Beyond their prestige labels, “ugly” fashion shoes offer women the luxury of speed and movement, lending energetic bounce to their stride, which is especially welcome in otherwise physically hindered times. And after such foot-freedom, will we ever again submit to the tortures of yore? For Jaine Mehring, a high-finance professional who appreciates fine fashion, the answer seems clear: “I really do have a stunning collection of Louboutins and Manolo Blahniks,” she says. But the thought of wearing “high heels now almost makes me anxious.” Garris Brown concurs: “I’ll be damned if I put those [high-end stilettoes] on my feet. I can feel pain before putting them on.”

Some of the most intriguing developments in luxury are taking place in recent collaborations among online gaming, high-end fashion, art and the NFT market. When the pandemic forced Balenciaga to shut down its runway shows in 2020, for example, the company wound up releasing its entire collection as a video game called “Afterworld: The Age of Tomorrow.” In fall 2021, it teamed with Fortnite to create a Balenciaga-designed immersive world online, complete with entirely virtual couture available for purchase and use in the game.

This fashion exists only digitally, yet it is bought with real money and “worn” — albeit by the game characters. It’s a form of virtual luxury escape that both transcends the body and grants a new version of that most bodily of pleasures: fashion. Dressing avatars in high-end couture, gamers experience a meta-version of the Before Times luxury of sartorial display. Gucci, Louis Vuitton, Burberry and other haute brands have also created digital games, which have soared in popularity throughout the pandemic.

These games and the social media buzz they generate are alluring gateways into high luxury for the next generation of consumers. “Social media and the gaming world … have been especially active for the luxury space,” says Jelani Day, executive vice president of Dapper Dan of Harlem (and the designer’s son). “Social media platforms and gaming communities [are] two of the biggest proverbial rooms that a luxury consumer can set foot in [and] are … driven by youth culture and younger consumers.”

Fashion is far from the only luxury good to go virtual. With the ever-expanding world of NFTs — non-fungible tokens — even art, that most tangible and three-dimensional of commodities, can now live an entirely digital life. NFT artworks, which are unique and exist only online, are now bought and sold exactly like “real” art. Almost anything can exist in NFT form — parcels of land, fashion, real estate — but NFT art is attaining stratospheric levels of both popularity and monetary value, with prices reaching into the multimillions. In March, an NFT video by the digital artist Mike Winkelmann, a.k.a. “Beeple,” sold at Christie’s for $69 million. Before October 2020, the priciest artwork Beeple had ever sold was a $100 print. According to the auction house, Beeple now ranks “among the top three most valuable living artists.”

[Perspective: Beeple’s digital ‘artwork’ sold for more than any painting by Titian or Raphael. But as art, it’s a great big zero.]

NFTs take the idea of luxury theater to a new level. As author and New York University business professor Scott Galloway told me, “I can buy a Picasso, but the value is only visible to the people I invite into my home. I can alternatively buy a crypto-punk NFT, whose value is verified on a decentralized ledger, and make it my Twitter profile picture to display to the thousands of users in my network. It’s still luxury, just scaled.”

Along with all these shifts has come a hopeful development: a heightened awareness of luxury’s — particularly fashion’s — most significant failings, especially the rampant racial inequities of the industry, as well as the environmental damage caused by the entire luxury sector.

“Luxury has had to evolve with the customers’ changed preferences and demands,” says Abrima Erwiah, the co-founder of Studio One Eighty Nine, which promotes African and African-inspired fashion, and inaugural director of the Gromek Institute for Fashion Business at Parsons. “We have seen more brands develop programs around DEI [diversity, equity and inclusion]. We have seen many industry shifts.” Erwiah cites the Black in Fashion Council, which emerged at the start of the pandemic and promotes the advancement of Black people at all levels across the industry. She also notes the significant presence of designers of color such as Abloh and Telfar Clemens. To that list we could add, among many other names, Edvin Thompson, Sergio Hudson and Aurora James (the founder of Brother Vellies, which focuses on sustainable luxury goods).

Faced with covid’s sobering reminder of our deep planetary interconnectedness, many luxury creators refocused their attention on the urgency of reducing the industry’s deleterious impact on the environment. Examples abound: Japanese luxury giant Takashimaya announced a massive fashion collection made from upcycled materials. Gucci launched its first sustainability collection, Off the Grid. And François-Henri Pinault, CEO of the Kering luxury group, announced a ban on fur across all his brands.

For many, luxury is now inextricable from social and environmental awareness: “There shouldn’t be a trade-off between what is luxurious and what is kind,” remarks Garris Brown, meaning kindness to both people and the Earth. Or as veteran luxury goods designer Mariza Scotch says, “The pandemic brought some key facts about our future into stark focus. … There was no way not to see the effects of continuing to live as we had.” For Scotch, “when we touch materials that are lovingly assembled, nurtured by the Earth and people, that’s something we can feel.”

Some traditional items — fine watches, jewelry and classic, exclusive handbags such as the Hermès Birkin — have seen strong sales throughout the pandemic. “Classic, well-made pieces are more desirable now,” says Leslie Ghize of Tobe TDG. It might appear, on the surface, that these items, often called “hard luxuries,” should have lost their luster in an era when traditional luxury theater is in decline. But it turns out that such objects hold a deep attraction far beyond their display value.

Given the pandemic’s continual reminder of life’s impermanence, possessions that feel solid and long-lasting can provide a kind of talismanic comfort — another way to challenge mortality. As Garris Brown says, “Real luxury lasts forever.” Hard luxuries bespeak a connection to history and tend to remain in families for generations. And the most iconic brands in this sector boast deep roots in the past, enhancing this sense of legacy and longevity — companies such as Rolex (founded in 1905), Cartier (1847) and Patek Philippe (1839).

All of this might explain the recent “great Rolex shortage” — a startling scarcity that left dealers’ vitrines empty and passionate collectors bereft. In September, Rolex explained the phenomenon this way: “Our current production cannot meet the existing demand … without reducing the quality of our watches — something we refuse to do.”

If all of this — the reassertion of older forms of luxury alongside the invention of new ones; the growing intersection of luxury with health, exercise, spirituality and digital life — makes your head spin, you’re not alone. The pandemic has shifted cultural bedrock, upending fundamental assumptions about value, pleasure, bodies, communication, freedom and even what constitutes ownership of a “thing” or traveling to a “place.”

Like virtual physical fitness, virtual spiritual fitness offers the promise of escape, a liberation from the constraints of lockdowns, isolations and even the body itself.

Yet perhaps the most dramatic broadening of luxury has taken place around the matter of time. When asked for their most valued luxury now, many people I interviewed for this article cited time first. It’s fair to say that the pandemic has altered our sense of time. It’s forced all of us to take stock of the brevity of our lives.

For many of us, time has seemed to warp, passing at once more swiftly and agonizingly slowly. Even odder still, we now realize that the pandemic itself will likely not have a distinct endpoint. There will be no day when we celebrate the struggle’s conclusion. Instead, the experts tell us, the coronavirus will gradually become endemic rather than pandemic, hovering over us like a shadow.

Covid, that is, disorients us in time, just as it disoriented us in space. We have addressed that spatial disorientation with virtual experiences of multiple kinds. Addressing temporal disorientation feels far harder: We can neither simulate nor escape time.

For this reason, time itself may turn out to be the ultimate luxury to emerge from the pandemic. To have enough time, to appreciate it fully, and to feel less troubled by its odd, telescoping and protracting nature — this might well prove the rarest and most sought-after of privileges.

The Resident Evil audition process was weird, because again, it's COVID. And so everyone's locked in their houses. You do a lot of [audition] tapes as an actor, so I basically peeled myself off of my couch and sort of organized a wall to make it look like I wasn’t completely living in filth. And then you just send [the tapes] away and, you know, you forget about it. And then a couple weeks later, I got the call from the director and we chatted about the part and sort of what his vision was for it. So yeah, that's mostly been my process. It's changed so much — even from the casting process for Victorious and the casting process for the films now — it's changed so much because of COVID.

THEN — Did you have a favorite scene or episode to film of Victorious?

It's funny, it's such a blur. Mostly, I don't remember shooting any specific scenes. I was so young, and — because of the content of [Victorious] — I was basically just having fun with my friends. I think the fun that we were having poured into the show itself. I think it came across to people how much fun we were having. But as far as what was occurring, it was like a fever dream. Oh, I did like dressing up in drag. That was fun.

NOW — Did you have a favorite scene to film of Resident Evil?

I think the rocket launcher scene in Resident Evil is my favorite. You very rarely get to do an ’80s-style action scene like this one where you say an action line and then shoot a rocket launcher — you know what I mean? Super campy and fun. To me, that's the sort of stuff where I'm like, ""Oh yeah, this is what movies are about."""

It’s nice and firm which I love because I feel that it provides more support that way. It also makes sleeping on my back more bearable because the two sides provide adequate support. The cover that it came with is like a jersey material and was nice and soft after I ran it through a wash cycle. The case was also extremely easy to remove and re-apply.

A: When it comes to how many people can be in the room, I think it varies depending on the place, but with COVID now, I am assuming it's only one or two. As I stated above, I had my mom in the room and my now-husband — that was plenty of people for me, but I *think* you can request more.

When it comes to strangers staring at your vagina — the pain of labor allowed me to get over any uncomfortableness really quickly. I didn't have time to think or focus on anything (or anyone) but the pain. Also, I just reminded myself beforehand that these healthcare workers come into work every day like, 'Another day, another vagina' — and mine was just another among the thousands they've seen.

Pro tip: Your doctor will likely ask if medical students can watch WHILE YOU'RE IN LABOR, so decide beforehand if you're OK with this...here's a real-life example:



""When my mom was delivering me, there was a whole class in the room. There were so many people, the doctor almost didn't let my dad in. She was in labor for less than two hours, it was all happening so fast she didn't have time to care who was in the room."" —pinkster"
